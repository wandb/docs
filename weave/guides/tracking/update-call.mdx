## Updating Calls

Calls are mostly immutable once created, however, there are a few mutations which are supported:
* [Set Display Name](#set-display-name)
* [Add Feedback](#add-feedback)
* [Delete a Call](#delete-a-call)

You can perform all of these mutations from the UI by navigating to the call detail page:

### Set display name

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
In order to set the display name of a call, you can use the [`Call.set_display_name()`](/weave/reference/python-sdk/trace/weave_client#method-set-display-name) method.

```python lines lines
import weave

# Initialize the client
client = weave.init("your-project-name")

# Get a specific call by its ID
call = client.get_call("call-uuid-here")

# Set the display name of the call
call.set_display_name("My Custom Display Name")
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
To set the display name of a call, use [`client.updateCall`](/weave/reference/typescript-sdk/classes/weaveclient#updatecall) to update by call ID directly:

```typescript lines
import * as weave from 'weave'

// Initialize the client
const client = await weave.init('your-project-name')

// Update the display name of a call by its ID
await client.updateCall('call-uuid-here', 'My Custom Display Name')
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="HTTP API">
To set the display name of a call using the Service API, you can make a request to the [`/call/update`](https://docs.wandb.ai/weave/reference/service-api/calls/call-update) endpoint.

```bash
curl -L 'https://trace.wandb.ai/call/update' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Accept: application/json' \
-d '{
    "project_id": "string",
    "call_id": "string",
    "display_name": "string",
}'
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

You can also [set a call's display name at execution](#set-call-display-name-at-execution).

### Add feedback 

Please see the [Feedback Documentation](/weave/guides/tracking/feedback) for more details.

### Delete a Call

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python">
To delete a Call using the Python API, you can use the [`Call.delete`](/weave/reference/python-sdk/trace/weave_client#method-delete) method.

```python lines lines
import weave

# Initialize the client
client = weave.init("your-project-name")

# Get a specific call by its ID
call = client.get_call("call-uuid-here")

# Delete the call
call.delete()
```

### Delete multiple Calls

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    To delete batches of Calls using the Python API, pass a list of Call IDs to `delete_calls()`.

    <Important>
    - The maximum amount of Calls that can be deleted is `1000`.
    - Deleting a Call also deletes all of its children.
    </Important>

    ```python lines lines
    import weave

    # Initialize the client
    client = weave.init("my-project")

    # Get all calls from client 
    all_calls = client.get_calls()

    # Get list of first 1000 Call objects
    first_1000_calls = all_calls[:1000]

    # Get list of first 1000 Call IDs
    first_1000_calls_ids = [c.id for c in first_1000_calls]

    # Delete first 1000 Call objects by ID
    client.delete_calls(call_ids=first_1000_calls_ids)
    ```
