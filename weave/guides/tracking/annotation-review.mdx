## Overview

Annotation queues provide a focused review interface for domain experts. You review one item at a time, examine the provided context, and submit structured feedback using predefined fields.

You do not need to understand the underlying model or tracing system to complete reviews.

---

## Review workflow

As an annotator, your task consists of:

1. Opening the shared annotation queue.
2. Reviewing each item in sequence.
3. Submitting feedback using the provided annotation fields.

Your progress is saved automatically as you move through the queue.

## Review a queue item

For each item, the review interface shows:
- Selected input context, such as prompts, documents, or images.
- The corresponding model output or decision.
- An annotation form with clearly labeled fields.

Complete each field according to the instructions provided for the queue, then submit the review to continue.

## Navigate and inspect context

You can move forward and backward through items in the queue at any time.

If additional context is needed, you can open the full trace view from the item header to inspect execution details, intermediate steps, or related metadata.

---

## Completion and progress

Your personal progress is tracked within the queue. Once all items have been reviewed, the queue reflects completion for your account.

No additional action is required after submitting reviews.
