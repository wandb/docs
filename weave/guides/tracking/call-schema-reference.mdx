This page provides a complete reference for the Call object schema in Weave. For information on querying calls, see [Query and export calls](/weave/guides/tracking/querying-calls).

## Call properties

The table below outlines the key properties of a Call in Weave. Please see the [schema](/weave/reference/python-sdk/trace_server/trace_server_interface#class-callschema) for the complete implementation.

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string (uuid) | Unique identifier for the call |
| `project_id` | string (optional) | Associated project identifier |
| `op_name` | string | Name of the operation (can be a reference) |
| `display_name` | string (optional) | User-friendly name for the call |
| `trace_id` | string (uuid) | Identifier for the trace this call belongs to |
| `parent_id` | string (uuid) | Identifier of the parent call |
| `started_at` | datetime | Timestamp when the call started |
| `attributes` | Dict[str, Any] | User-defined metadata about the call *(read-only during execution)* |
| `inputs` | Dict[str, Any] | Input parameters for the call |
| `ended_at` | datetime (optional) | Timestamp when the call ended |
| `exception` | string (optional) | Error message if the call failed |
| `output` | Any (optional) | Result of the call |
| `summary` | Optional[SummaryMap] | Post-execution summary information. You can modify this during execution to record custom metrics. |
| `wb_user_id` | Optional[str] | Associated Weights & Biases user ID |
| `wb_run_id` | Optional[str] | Associated Weights & Biases run ID |
| `deleted_at` | datetime (optional) | Timestamp of call deletion, if applicable |

## Property details

Each property plays a crucial role in tracking and managing function calls:

- The `id`, `trace_id`, and `parent_id` fields help in organizing and relating calls within the system.
- Timing information (`started_at`, `ended_at`) allows for performance analysis.
- The `attributes` and `inputs` fields provide context for the call. Attributes are frozen once the call starts, so set them before invocation with `weave.attributes`. `output` and `summary` capture the results, and you can update `summary` during execution to log additional metrics.
- Integration with Weights & Biases is facilitated through `wb_user_id` and `wb_run_id`.

This comprehensive set of properties enables detailed tracking and analysis of function calls throughout your project.

## Calculated fields

<!--In addition to the properties stored directly on the Call object, Weave calculates the following fields:-->

* **Cost**      <!--: The total cost of the call, including any LLM API costs-->
* **Duration**    <!--: The time elapsed between `started_at` and `ended_at`-->
* **Status**      <!--: The execution status (success, error, running)-->
