## View a W&B run in the Traces table

With Weave, you can trace function calls in your code and link them directly to the [W&B runs](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/runs/) in which they were executed. 
When you trace a function with @weave.op() and call it inside a wandb.init() context, Weave automatically associates the trace with the W&B run. 
Links to any associated runs are shown in the Traces table.

The following Python code shows how traced operations are linked to W&B
runs when executed inside a `wandb.init()` context. These traces appear in the
Weave UI and are associated with the corresponding run.

```python lines 
import wandb
import weave

def example_wandb(projname):
    # Split projname into entity and project
    entity, project = projname.split("/", 1)

    # Initialize Weave context for tracing
    weave.init(projname)

    # Define a traceable operation
    @weave.op()
    def say(message: str) -> str:
        return f"I said: {message}"

    # First W&B run
    with wandb.init(
        entity=entity,
        project=project,
        notes="Experiment 1",
        tags=["baseline", "paper1"],
    ) as run:
        say("Hello, world!")
        say("How are you!")
        run.log({"messages": 2})

    # Second W&B run
    with wandb.init(
        entity=entity,
        project=project,
        notes="Experiment 2",
        tags=["baseline", "paper1"],
    ) as run:
        say("Hello, world from experiment 2!")
        say("How are you!")
        run.log({"messages": 2})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace this with your actual W&B username/project
    example_wandb("your-username/your-project")
```

To use the code sample:

1. In the terminal, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install wandb weave
```

2. Log in to W&B:

```bash
wandb login
```

3. In the script, replace `your-username/your-project` with your actual W&B entity/project.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python weave_trace_with_wandb.py
```
5. Visit [https://weave.wandb.ai](https://weave.wandb.ai) and select your project.
6. In the **Traces** tab, view the trace output. Links to any associated runs are shown in the Traces table.
