In Weave, when using an Op, the functions can be called directly as you would with any function:

```python
@weave.op
def my_op():
    ...

my_op()
```


However, you can instead get access to the Call object directly by invoking the `op.call` method, which returns both the result and the `Call` object.

    ```python
@weave.op
def my_op():
    ...

output, call = my_op.call()
    ```
From here, the `call` object contains all the information about the call, including the inputs, outputs, and other metadata. You can use `call` to set, update, fetch additional properties, or add feedback.

If your Op is a method on a class, you need to pass the instance of the class as the first argument to `call`. The following example shows getting a handle to a Call object that is a method on a class:
    ```python
    import weave

    # Initialize Weave Tracing
    weave.init("intro-example")

    class MyClass:
        # Decorate your method
        @weave.op
        def my_method(self, name: str):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

    instance = MyClass()

    # Pass `instance` as the first argument to `call`.
    result, call = instance.my_method.call(instance, "World")
    ```
