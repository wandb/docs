    Sometimes it is useful to get a handle to the `Call` object itself. You can do this by calling the `op.call` method, which returns both the result and the `Call` object. For example:

    ```python lines lines
    result, call = my_function.call("World")
    ```

    Then you can use `call` to set, update, or fetch additional properties (most commonly used to get the ID of the call to be used for feedback).

    <Note>
    If your op is a method on a class, you need to pass the instance as the first argument to the op (see example below).
    </Note>
    ```python lines lines
    # Notice that we pass the `instance` as the first argument.
    print(instance.my_method.call(instance, "World"))
    ```

    ```python lines lines
    import weave

    # Initialize Weave Tracing
    weave.init("intro-example")

    class MyClass:
        # Decorate your method
        @weave.op
        def my_method(self, name: str):
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

    instance = MyClass()

    # Call your method -- Weave will automatically track inputs and outputs
    instance.my_method.call(instance, "World")
    ```

### How do I capture information about a Call?

Typically you would call an op directly:

```python lines
@weave.op
def my_op():
    ...

my_op()
```

However, you can also get access to the call object directly by invoking the `call` method on the op:

```python lines
@weave.op
def my_op():
    ...

output, call = my_op.call()
```

From here, the `call` object contains all the information about the call, including the inputs, outputs, and other metadata.
