description: "Track sync and async generator functions with Weave tracing"
---

W&B Weave supports tracing both sync and async generator functions, including deeply nested patterns.

<Warning>
Since generators yield values lazily, the outputs are only logged when the generator is fully consumed (such as by converting it to a list).
To ensure outputs are captured in the trace, fully consume the generator (for example, by using `list()`).

    ```python
    from typing import Generator
    import weave

    weave.init("my-project")

    # This function uses a simple sync generator.
    # Weave will trace the call and its input (`x`),
    # but output values are only captured once the generator is consumed (for example, with `list()`).
    @weave.op
    def basic_gen(x: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
        yield from range(x)

    # A normal sync function used within the generator pipeline.
    # Its calls are also traced independently by Weave.
    @weave.op
    def inner(x: int) -> int:
        return x + 1

    # A sync generator that calls another traced function (`inner`).
    # Each yielded value comes from a separate traced call to `inner`.
    @weave.op
    def nested_generator(x: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
        for i in range(x):
            yield inner(i)

    # A more complex generator that composes the above generator.
    # Tracing here produces a hierarchical call tree:
    # - `deeply_nested_generator` (parent)
    #   - `nested_generator` (child)
    #     - `inner` (grandchild)
    @weave.op
    def deeply_nested_generator(x: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]:
        for i in range(x):
            for j in nested_generator(i):
                yield j

    # The generator must be *consumed* for Weave to capture outputs.
    # This is true for both sync and async generators.
    res = deeply_nested_generator(4)
    list(res)  # Triggers tracing of all nested calls and yields

## Consuming generators

Weave captures generator outputs only after the generator is fully consumed. Consume the generator by iterating over it (for example, with `list()`, a `for` loop, or `next()` until exhaustion). The same applies to async generators when using `async for` or equivalent consumption.

For more on decorating functions and methods with `@weave.op`, see [Tracing Basics](/weave/guides/tracking/tracing#2-decorating-and-wrapping-functions).
