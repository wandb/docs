description: "Map columns in datasets to different names. This helps you align the column names in your dataset with the column names expected by the scorer."

You can use the `column_map` attribute to tell the scorers which dataset columns to use. The `column_map` attribute requires you to set the following keys:
- `output`: Model prediction
- `target`: Reference answer to compare with

The following example maps the `output` and `target` columns to a dataset's `model_output` and `answer` columns, respectively:

```python
from weave.scorers import EmbeddingSimilarityScorer

similarity_scorer = EmbeddingSimilarityScorer()

similarity_scorer.column_map = {
    "output": "model_output",  # The model's generated text
    "target": "answer"        # The expected or reference response
}
```
