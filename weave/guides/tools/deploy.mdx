## Deploy to Google Cloud

<Note>
`weave deploy` requires your machine to have `gcloud` installed and configured. `weave deploy gcp` will use pre-configured configuration when not directly specified by command line arguments.
</Note>

To deploy a Weave model to Google Cloud, run:

```
weave deploy gcp <ref>
```

Once deployed, the terminal returns a URL using the following schema:

``` 
Service URL: <PATH_TO_MODEL>`. Visit `<PATH_TO_MODEL>/docs` to interact with your model!
```
