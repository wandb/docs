title: Limits and expected behaviors
description: A list of Weave's limitations, known issues, and expected behaviors
---

* For retryable requests, Weave retries requests starting at 1 second after receiving the first error and then doubles the amount of time between attempts up to 5 minutes. Requests timeout after 36 hours.

* Instead of raising exceptions, [`.call()`](/weave/guides/tracking/tracing#creating-calls) captures exceptions and stores them in the `call.exception`. If you need to raise exceptions during execution, set the [`__should_raise` parameter](/weave/reference/python-sdk/trace/op#function-call), like this:

    ```python showLineNumbers
    # This raises exceptions
    result, call = foo.call(__should_raise=True)
    ```

* Dedicated Weave instances use a different OpenTelemetry ingress URL. See [Send OpenTelemetry Traces](/weave/guides/tracking/otel) for authoritative endpoint information.

* Weave sometimes truncates large trace data objects. This occurs because default trace output is a raw, custom Python object that Weave doesn’t know how to serialize. To return all of your trace data, define a dictionary of strings, like this: 

    ```python
    import weave
    
    class MyObj:
        """An object with a large string attribute."""
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            self.x = x
    
        def __repr__(self):
            return f"MyObj(x={self.x})"
    
        def to_dict(self):
            return {"x": self.x}
    
    @weave.op()
    def make_my_obj():
        x = "a" * 10_000
        return MyObj(x)
    
    def main():
        weave.init("<entity/project>")
    
        # Define a traceable operation that processes MyObj
        @weave.op()
        def process_obj(obj: MyObj) -> int:
            return len(obj.x)
    
        # Create and process a large MyObj instance
        large_obj = make_my_obj()
        length = process_obj(large_obj)
        print(f"Length of x in MyObj: {length}")
        print("dict:", large_obj.to_dict())
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
