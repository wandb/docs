Learn how to track LLM calls with Weave by adding tracing to your code. This quickstart walks you through tracing a request to OpenAI and viewing the results in the Weave UI.

## What you'll learn:

This guide shows you how to:

* Import and configure Weave in your code
* Use `weave.op` decorator to track your code
* View traces in the Weave UI

<WeaveQuickstartPrereqs/>

## Log a trace to a new project

To begin tracking your code and logging traces to Weave:

1. Import the `weave` library into your code.
2. Call `weave.init('your_wb_team/project_name')` in your code to send tracking information to your W&B [team](/platform/app/settings-page/teams) and [project](/platform/hosting/iam/org_team_struct#project). If you do not set a team, the traces are sent to your [default team](/platform/app/settings-page/user-settings/#default-team). If the specified project does not exist in your team, Weave creates it.
3. Add the [`@weave.op()` decorator](/weave/guides/tracking/ops) to specific functions you want to track. While Weave automatically tracks calls to supported LLMs, adding the Weave decorator allows you to track the inputs, outputs, and code of specific functions. The decorator uses the following syntax in TypeScript: `weave.op(your_function)`

The following example code sends a request to OpenAI (requires [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key)) and Weave records the request's tracing information. The request asks the OpenAI model to extract dinosaur names from the input and identify each dinosaur's diet (herbivore or carnivore).

Run the following example code to track your first project with Weave:

      );
      console.log(result);

When you call the `extract_dinos` function, Weave outputs links to view your traces in the terminal. The output looks like this:

```shell
weave:  $ pip install weave --upgrade
weave: Logged in as Weights & Biases user: example-username.

    },
    {

## See traces of your application in your project

Click the link in your terminal or paste it into your browser to open the Weave UI. In the **Traces** panel of the Weave UI, you can click on the trace to see its data, such as its input, output, latency, and token usage.

## Learn more about Traces

- Learn how to [decorate your functions and retrieve call information](/weave/tracing).
- Try the [Playground](/weave/guides/tools/playground) to test different models on logged traces.
- [Explore integrations](/weave/guides/integrations/). Weave automatically tracks calls made to OpenAI, Anthropic and many more LLM libraries. If your LLM library isn't currently one of our integrations you can track calls to other LLMs libraries or frameworks easily by wrapping them with `@weave.op()`.
