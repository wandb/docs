<Tip>
Try our [W&B Inference quickstart](/weave/quickstart-inference) to get started without external API keys.

W&B Weave makes it easy to track and evaluate your LLM applications. Follow these steps to track your first call or <a className="vertical-align-colab-button" target="_blank" href="http://wandb.me/weave_colab"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

## 1. Install W&B Weave and create an API Key

**Install weave**

First install the weave library:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    pip install weave
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    pnpm install weave
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Get your API key**

Then, create a [Weights & Biases (W&B) account](https://wandb.ai) and [copy your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize).

## 2. Log a trace to a new project

To get started with tracking your first project with Weave:

1. Import the `weave` library
2. Call `weave.init('project-name')` to start tracking
    - When you run your code, Weave prompts you to log in with your API key if you are not yet logged in on your machine.
    - To log to a specific W&B Team name, replace `project-name` with `team-name/project-name`. If you don't specify a W&B team, your default entity is used. To find or update your default entity, refer to [User Settings](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/app/settings-page/user-settings/#default-team) in the W&B Models documentation.
    
    **NOTE:** In automated environments, you can define the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY` with your API key to login without prompting.
3. Add the `@weave.op()` decorator to the Python functions you want to track

The following example trace calls to OpenAI and requires an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/step-2-setup-your-api-key).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # highlight-next-line
    import weave
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI()

    # Weave will track the inputs, outputs and code of this function
    # highlight-next-line
    @weave.op()
    def extract_dinos(sentence: str) -> dict:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "system",
                    "content": """In JSON format extract a list of `dinosaurs`, with their `name`,
    their `common_name`, and whether its `diet` is a herbivore or carnivore"""
                },
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": sentence
                }
                ],
                response_format={ "type": "json_object" }
            )
        return response.choices[0].message.content


    # Initialise the weave project
    # highlight-next-line
    weave.init('jurassic-park')

    sentence = """I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), \
    both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant \
    Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below."""

    result = extract_dinos(sentence)
    print(result)
    ```
    When you call the `extract_dinos` function Weave will output a link to view your trace.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```typescript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';
    // highlight-next-line
    import * as weave from 'weave';
    
    // highlight-next-line
    const openai = new OpenAI();
  
    async function extractDinos(input: string) {
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-4o',
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: `In JSON format extract a list of 'dinosaurs', with their 'name', their 'common_name', and whether its 'diet' is a herbivore or carnivore: ${input}`,
          },
        ],
      });
      return response.choices[0].message.content;
    }
    // highlight-next-line
    const extractDinosOp = weave.op(extractDinos);

    async function main() {
      // highlight-next-line
      await weave.init('examples');
      const result = await extractDinosOp(
        'I watched as a Tyrannosaurus rex (T. rex) chased after a Triceratops (Trike), both carnivore and herbivore locked in an ancient dance. Meanwhile, a gentle giant Brachiosaurus (Brachi) calmly munched on treetops, blissfully unaware of the chaos below.'
      );
      console.log(result);
    }

    main();

    ```
    When you call the `extractDinos` function, Weave outputs a link to view your trace.

## 3. Automated LLM library logging

Weave automatically tracks calls made to OpenAI, Anthropic and [many more LLM libraries](/weave/guides/integrations) and logs their **LLM metadata**, **token usage** and **cost**. If your LLM library isn't currently one of our integrations you can track calls to other LLMs libraries or frameworks easily by wrapping them with `@weave.op()`.

## 4. See traces of your application in your project

Once you've configured your Weave in your project, Weave automatically captures the input & output data, and logs any changes made to the code.
