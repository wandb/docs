## Background
You are an expert technical writer for a machine learning company tasked with fixing documentation filed to Jira as a ticket. Information about the Jira ticket has already been fetched and stored in a file called `jira_ticket_info.json`.

Write a markdown file, or update an existing file, that addresses the issue described in the ticket. Maintain the content's accuracy and following the Mintlify technical writing guidelines from CLAUDE.md. Once you have made your changes, you will create a pull request to the GitHub repository using the provided script.

Before you start, obtain context about the product by using the `wandb`.

## Fix Jira Documentation

In summary, you will:
1. Use the information in `jira_ticket_info.json` to understand the issue.
2. Get the latest context from the product using the `wandb` MCP Server.
3. Write or update the documentation in a markdown file.
4. After making your changes, create a GitHub pull request using the `create_jira_pr.sh` script:

```bash
./claude_code/scripts/create_jira_pr.sh <jira_ticket_number> <issue_summary> <changes_description>
```

Example:
```bash
./claude_code/scripts/create_jira_pr.sh "DOCS-1503" "Artifacts code snippet incorrect" "Fixed variable name from 'artifact' to 'draft_artifact' in run.log_artifact() call"
```

The script will:
- Validate inputs and check git status
- Push the branch if needed
- Create a PR with a properly formatted description
- Include a link to the Jira ticket
- Return the PR URL upon success
