<Update label="v0.60.0" description="September 26, 2024">
<Note>
Due to a release versioning issue, 0.60.0 is the next major release after 0.58.0. The 0.59.0 was one of the patch releases for 0.58.0.
</Note>

## Features
* Final updates for 1.1.1 Compliance of Level AA 2.2 for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards.
* W&B can now turn off auto-version-upgrade for Self-Managed instances using the W&B kubernetes operator. You can request this to your W&B team.
  W&B requires all instances to upgrade periodically to comply with the 6-month end-of-life period for each version. W&B does not support versions older than 6 months.

## Fixes
* Fixed a bug to allow instance admins on Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed instances to access workspaces in personal entities.
* SCIM Groups and Users GET endpoints now filter out service accounts from the responses. Only non service account users are now returned by those endpoints.
* Fixed a user management bug by removing the ability of team admins to simultaneously delete a user from the overall instance while deleting them from a team. Instance or Org admins are responsible to delete a user from the overall instance / organization.

## Performance improvements
* Reduced the latency when adding a panel by up to 90% in workspaces with many metrics.
* Improved the reliability and performance of parquet exports to blob storage when runs are resumed often. 
  Runs export to blob storage in parquet format is available on Dedicated Cloud and on Self-Managed instances that are enabled using the W&B kubernetes operator.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.58.1" description="September 4, 2024">
## Features
* W&B now supports sub-path for **Secure storage connector i.e. Bring your own bucket** capability. You can now provide a sub-path when configuring a bucket at the instance or team level. This is only available for new bucket configurations and not for existing configured buckets.
* W&B-managed storage on newer Dedicated Cloud instances in Google Cloud & Azure will by default be encrypted with **W&B managed cloud-native keys**. This is already available on AWS instances. Each instance storage is encrypted with a key unique to the instance. Until now, all instances on Google Cloud & Azure relied on default cloud provider-managed encryption keys.
* Makes the fields in the run config and summary copyable on click.
* If you're using W&B kubernetes operator for a Self-Managed instance, you can now optionally use a custom CA for the controller manager.
* We've modified the W&B kubernetes operator to run in a non-root context by default, aligning with OpenShift's Security Context Constraints (SCCs). This change ensures smoother deployment of Self-Managed instances on OpenShift by adhering to its security policies.

## Fixes
* Fixed an issue where exporting panels from a workspace to a report now correctly respects the panel search regex.
* Fixed an issue where setting `GORILLA_DISABLE_PERSONAL_ENTITY` to `true` was not disabling users from creating projects and writing to existing projects in their personal entities.

## Performance improvements
* We have significantly improved performance and stability for experiments with 100k+ logged points. On a Self-Managed instance, this is available if the deployment is managed using the W&B kubernetes operator.
* Fixed issue where saving changes in large workspaces would be very slow or fail.
* Improved latency of opening workspace sections in large workspaces.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.57.2" description="July 24, 2024">
## Features

**You can now use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) to access your W&B instance from the wandb SDK or CLI, using the identity federation capability. The feature is in preview.** Refer to [Identity federation](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/identity_federation) and reach out to your W&B team for any questions.

* New `Add to reports` drawer improvements for exporting Workspace panels into Reports.
* Artifacts metadata filtering in the artifact project browser.
* Pass in artifact metadata in webhook payload via `${artifact_metadata.KEY}`.
* Added GPU memory usage panels to the RunSystemMetrics component, enhancing GPU metrics visualization for runs in the app frontend.
* Mobile users now enjoy a much smoother, more intuitive Workspace experience.
* If you're using W&B Dedicated Cloud on Google Cloud or Azure, you can now enable private connectivity for your instance, thus ensuring that all traffic from your AI workloads and optionally browser clients only transit the cloud provider private network. Refer to [Private connectivity](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/data-security/private-connectivity) and reach out to your W&B team for any questions.
* Team-level service accounts are now shown separately in a new tab in the team settings view. The service accounts are not listed in the Members tab anymore. Also, the API key is now hidden and can only be copied by team admins.
* Dedicated Cloud is now available in Google Cloud's Seoul region.

## Fixes

* Gaussian smoothing was extremely aggressive on many plots.
* Fixed issue where pressing the `Ignore Outliers in Chart Scaling` button currently has no effect in the UI workspace.
* Disallow inviting deactivated users to an organization.
* Fixed an issue where users added to an instance using SCIM API could not onbioard successfully.

## Performance improvements

* Significantly improved performance when editing a panel's settings and applying the changes.
* Improved the responsiveness of run visibility toggling in large workspaces.
* Improved chart hovering and brushing performance on plots in large workspaces.
* Reduced workspace memory usage and loading times in workspaces with many keys.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.56.0" description="June 29, 2024">
<Note>
Due to a release versioning issue, 0.56.0 is the next major release after 0.54.0. The 0.55.0 was a patch release for 0.54.0.
</Note>

## Features

* The new Full Fidelity line plot in W&B Experiments enhances the visibility of training metrics by aggregating all data along the x-axis, displaying the minimum, maximum, and average values within each bucket, allowing users to easily spot outliers and zoom into high-fidelity details without downsampling loss.  [Learn more in our documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/app/features/panels/line-plot/sampling).
* You can now use [cross-cloud storage buckets for team-level BYOB (secure storage connector)](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector#cross-cloud-or-s3-compatible-storage-for-team-level-byob) in Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed instances. For example, in a W&B instance on AWS, you can now configure Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud Storage for team-level BYOB, and so on for each cross-cloud combination. 
* In the same vein, you can now use [S3-compatible storage buckets like MinIO for team-level BYOB (secure storage connector)](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector#cross-cloud-or-s3-compatible-storage-for-team-level-byob) in Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed instances. For example, in a W&B instance on Google Cloud, you can configure a MinIO bucket hosted in cloud or on-prem for team-level BYOB.
* Admins can now automate full deletion of users in their Dedicated Cloud or Self-Managed instances using the [SCIM API's DELETE User endpoint](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/scim#delete-user). The user deactivation operation has been reimplemented using the [PATCH User endpoint](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/scim#deactivate-user), along with the introduction of [user reactivation operation](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/scim#reactivate-user).
* If you use the SCIM API, you will also see a couple of minor improvements:
  The API now has a more pertinent error message in case of authentication failures.
  Relevant endpoints now return the full name of a user in the SCIM User object if it's available.

## Fixes

* The fix resolves an issue where deleting a search term from a runset in a report could delete the panel or cause the report to crash by ensuring proper handling of selected text during copy/paste operations.
* The fix addresses a problem with indenting bulleted items in reports, which was caused by an upgrade of slate and an additional check in the normalization process for elements.
* The fix resolves an issue where text could not be selected from a panel when the report was in edit mode.
* The fix addresses an issue where copy-pasting an entire panel grid in a Report using command-c was broken.
* The fix resolves an issue where report sharing with a magic link was broken when a team had the `Hide this team from all non-members` setting enabled.
* The fix introduces proper handling for restricted projects by allowing only explicitly invited users to access them, and implementing permissions based on project members and team roles.
* The fix allows instance admins to write to their own named workspaces, read other personal and shared workspaces, and write to shared views in private and public projects.
* The fix resolves an issue where the report would crash when trying to edit filters due to an out-of-bounds filter index caused by skipping non-individual filters while keeping the index count incremental.
* The fix addresses an issue where unselecting a runset caused media panels to crash in a report by ensuring only runs in enabled runsets are returned.
* The fix resolves an issue where the parameter importance panel crashes on initial load due to a violation of hooks error caused by a change in the order of hooks.
* The fix prevents chart data from being reloaded when scrolling down and then back up in small workspaces, enhancing performance and eliminating the feeling of slowness.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.54.0" description="May 24, 2024">
## Features
* You can now configure Secure storage connector (BYOB) at team-level in Dedicated Cloud or Self-Managed instances on Microsoft Azure. 
  Refer to [this Terraform Module](https://github.com/wandb/terraform-azurerm-wandb/tree/main/modules/secure_storage_connector) and reach out to your W&B team for any questions.

  W&B recommends to notify team admins and other users before making such enforcement changes.
* Enable direct lineage option for artifact lineage DAG
* It's now possible to restrict Organization or Instance Admins from self-joining or adding themselves to a W&B team, thus ensuring that only Data & AI personas have access to the projects within the teams. 
  W&B advises to exercise caution and understand all implications before enabling this setting. Reach out to your W&B team for any questions.
* Dedicated Cloud on AWS is now also available in the Seoul (S. Korea) region.

## Fixes

</Update>

<Update label="v0.52.2" description="April 25, 2024">
## Features

* You can now enforce username and full name for users in your organization, by using OIDC claims from your SSO provider. Reach out to your W&B team or support if interested.
* You can now disable use of personal projects in your organization to ensure that all projects are created within W&B teams and governed using admin-enforced guidelines. Reach out to your W&B team or support if interested.
* Option to expand all versions in a cluster of runs or artifacts in the Artifacts Lineage DAG view.
* UI improvements to Artifacts Lineage DAG - the type will now be visible for each entry in a cluster.

## Fixes
* Added pagination to image panels in media banks, displaying up to 32 images per page with enhanced grid aesthetics and improved pagination controls, while introducing a workaround for potential offset inconsistencies.
* Resolved an issue where tooltips on system charts were not displaying by enforcing the `isHovered` parameter, which is essential for the crosshair UI visibility.
* Unset the max-width property for images within media panels, addressing unintended style constraints previously applied to all images.

<Update label="v0.51.0" description="March 20, 2024">
## Features

* You can now save multiple views of any workspace by clicking "Save as a new view" in the overflow menu of the workspace bar.
  See [Saved workspace views](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/app/pages/workspaces#create-saved-workspace-views) to learn more.

  <Frame>
  ![Image showing saved views](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/7208315/862a36ac-8ce4-49e7-8677-d87d54ab1e54)
  </Frame>
* You can now [set a project's visibility scope to Restricted](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/access-management/restricted-projects/) if you want to collaborate on AI workflows related to sensitive or confidential data. 
  When you create a **restricted project** within a team, you can add specific members from the team. Unlike other project visibility scopes, all members of a team do not get implicit access to a restricted project.
* **Enhanced Run Overview page performance**: now 91% faster on load, with search functionality improved by 99.9%. Also enjoy RegEx search for Config and Summary data. 
* **New UX for Artifacts Lineage DAG** introduces clustering for 5+ nodes at the same level, preview window to examine a node's details, and a significant speedup in the graph's loading time.
* The template variable values used for a run executed by launch, for example GPU type and quantity, are now shown on the queue's list of runs.  This makes it  easier to see which runs are requesting which resources.
* Cloning a run with Launch now pre-selects the overrides, queue, and template variable values used by the cloned run.
* Instance admins will now see a `Teams` tab in the organization dashboard. It can be used to join a specific team when needed, whether it's to monitor the team activity as per organizational guidelines or to help the team when team admins are not available. 
* SCIM User API now returns the `groups` attribute as part of the GET endpoint, which includes the id of the groups / teams a user is part of.
* All Dedicated Cloud instances on Google Cloud are now managed using the new [W&B Kubernetes Operator](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/operator/). With that, the new Parquet Store service is also available. 
  Parquet store allows performant & cost efficient storage of run history data in parquet format in the blob storage. Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS & Azure are already managed using the operator and include the parquet store.
* Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS have been updated to use the latest version of the relational data storage, and the compute infrastructure has been upgraded to a newer generation with better performance.

> **Advanced Notice**: We urge all customers who use Webhooks with Automations to add a valid A-record for their endpoints as we are going to disallow using IP address based Webhook URLs from the next release onwards. This is being done to protect against SSRF vulnerability and other related threat vectors.

## Fixes

* Fixed issue where expressions tab was not rendering for line plots.
* Use display name for sweeps when grouped by sweeps in charts and runs table.
* Auto navigation to runs page when selecting job version.
</Update>

* You can now automate user role assignment for organization or team scopes using the [SCIM role assignment API](https://docs.wandb.ai/platform/hosting/iam/scim/#assign-organization-level-role-to-user).
* All Dedicated Cloud instances on AWS & Azure are now managed using the new W&B Kubernetes Operator. With that, the new Parquet Store service is also available. The service allows for performant & cost efficient storage of run history data in parquet format in the blob storage. That in turn leads to faster loading of relevant history data in charts & plots that are used to evaluate the runs.
* W&B Kubernetes Operator and along with that the Parquet Store service are now available for use in Self-Managed instances. We encourage customers that already use Kubernetes to host W&B, to reach out to their W&B team on how they can use the operator. And we highly recommend others to migrate to Kubernetes in order to receive the latest performance improvements and new services in future via operator. We're happy to assist with planning such a migration.

  We're continuing to enhance our core metric visualization experience.   You can now define which metrics from regular expressions to render in your plots, up to 100 metrics at once.   And to more accurately represent data at high scale, we've add a new time-weighted exponential moving average smoothing algorithm for plots ([check out all of our supported algorithms](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/app/features/panels/line-plot/smoothing#docusaurus_skipToContent_fallback)).

## Fixes
* Major improvement to artifact download speed: over a 6x speedup on our 1-million-file artifact benchmark.  Please upgrade to SDK version 0.15.5+.  
* (Launch) Optuna is now available as [a sweeps scheduler with Sweeps on Launch](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch/sweeps-on-launch#create-a-custom-sweep-scheduler), allowing more efficient exploration of hyperparameters.
* Run data permadeletion is now available (default off).  This can be enabled with the GORILLA_DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD environment variable, specified in hours.  Please take care before updating this variable and/or chat with W&B Support, since the deletion is permanent.  Artifacts will not be deleted by this setting.  
* Updated report sharing emails to include a preview.
* Relaxed HTML sanitation rules for reports in projects; this had been causing rare problems with report rendering.
* Expanded the maximum number of metrics that can be matched by a regex in chart configuration; previously this had been always 10, the maximum is now 100.
* Fixed issue with media panel step slider becoming unsynced with the media shown.
* Added time-weighted exponential moving average as an option for smoothing in plots.
* The "Search panels" textbox in workspaces now preserves the user's last search.
* Applying a username filter when runs are grouped will no longer error.
* (Launch) The loading of the Launch tab should now be much faster, typically under two seconds.
* (Launch) There’s now an option to edit queue configs using YAML instead of JSON.  It’s also now more clear how to edit queue configs.
* (Launch) Runs will now show error messages in the UI when they crash or fail.
* (Launch) If you don’t specify a project when creating a job, we’ll now use the value for WANDB_PROJECT from your wandb.init.
* (Launch) Updated support for custom accelerator images—these will run in noninteractive mode when building, which had been blocking some images.
* (Launch) Fixed issue where the run author for sweeps was the agent service account, rather than the real author
* (Launch) Clicking outside the Launch drawer will no longer close the drawer automatically.
* (Launch) Fixed issue where training jobs that had been enqueued by a sweep but not run yet were not correctly removed from the queue if you later stopped the sweep.
* (Launch) The Launch navigation link is now hidden for users who aren't part of the team.
* (Launch) Fixed formatting and display issues on Agent logs.
* Fixed scrolling, resizing, and cloning issues in Automations panel.
* Fixed pagination on artifact action history.
* Added support for pre-signed URLs using a VPC endpoint URL if the AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL env var is set and passed in from the SDK side.
* Fixed enterprise dashboard link when organization name contains "&"
* Updated tag colors to be consistent

  If you want to repeat a run but tweak a couple hyperparameters--say bump the batch size to take advantage of a larger machine--it's now easy to clone a run using W&B Launch. Go to the run overview, click Clone, and you'll be able to select new infrastructure to execute the job on, with new hyperparameters.  Learn more in the [Launch documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/launch).

## Features 

- New Model Registry UI

  <Frame>
  ![New Model Registry UI featuring list view, model filtering, version management, and automation controls](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/97066933/3fedbdb8-aa79-4fb6-aab8-bddd8899e8dc)
  </Frame>

  We’re making it easier for users to manage a long list of models, and navigate seamlessly between entities in the model registry.  With this new UI, users can:
- Look at all your registered models
- Filter to registered models within a specific team
- With the new list view, users can expand each panel to see the individual versions inside of it, including each version's aliases, and metadata or run metrics. Clicking on a version from this quick view can take you to it's version-view
- Look at an overview directly by clicking “View Details”
- See a preview of how many version, consumers, and automations are present for each registered model
- Create Automations directly
- See some metadata columns and details in preview
- Change Model Access Controls

## Fixes
- Improved search functionality for better universal search ranking results.
- Added functionality to add/delete multiple tags at once in the model registry
- Enhanced the FileMarkdown feature to correctly scroll long content.
- Made the default team selection dropdown scrollable.
- Removed the UI access restriction for Tier 1/2/3 plans based on tracked hour usage.
- Added tooltips to for LLM trace viewer spans

  ![Image showing Model registry admin role](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/97066933/b0fc6389-b8a6-437a-91a3-a991e69bca0d)
  </Frame>
  Control your model promotion process with a new role for model registry admins.   These users can manage the list of protected aliases (for example, “challenger” or “prod”), as well as apply or remove protected aliases for model versions.
- Viewer role
  You can now share your W&B findings with a broader audience with the introduction of a Viewer role for W&B Server.  Users with this role can view anything their team(s) make, but not create, edit, or delete anything.   These seats are measured separately from traditional W&B Server seats, so reach out your W&B account team to request an updated license.
- Improved sharing: optional magic link, and easier signup for viewers
  Team admins can now turn off magic link sharing for a team and its members.  Disable public sharing on the team setting allows you increase team privacy controls.  Meanwhile, it’s now easier for users who receive a report link to access the report in W&B after signing up.
- Improved report composition
  <Frame>
  ![Improved report composition interface with enhanced draft publication, editing, and collaboration features](https://github.com/wandb/server/assets/97066933/c2858fd5-d2f6-47e3-9e93-f8d048df4f59)

  Reports help share your findings W&B further throughout an organization, including with people outside the ML team. We’ve made several investments to ensure it’s as simple and frictionless as possible to create and share them—including an improved report drafting experience with enhanced draft publication, editing, management, and sharing UX to improve how teams collaborate with Reports. 
- Updated navigation
  As W&B has expanded the parts of the ML workflow we cover, we’ve heard your feedback that it can be hard to move around the application.   So we’ve updated the navigation sidebar to include clearer labels on the product area, and added backlinks to certain detail screens.   We’ve also renamed “Triggers” to “Automations” to better reflect the power of the feature.

## Fixes
- When hovering over a plot in workspaces or a report, you can now use Cmd+C or Ctrl+C to copy run names and plot values shown in the hover control.
- Changes to default workspaces are now no longer auto-saved.
- Metrics in the Overview → Summary section now are formatted with commas.
- Added an install-level option to allow non-admin users to create teams (default off; contact W&B support to enable it).
