This page includes release notes for the W&B Python SDK (`wandb` package). For W&B Server, see [W&B Server release notes](/release-notes/server-releases).

<Update label="0.24.0" description="January 13, 2026">
## Notable Changes

This version removes the legacy, deprecated `wandb.beta.workflows` module, including its `log_model()`/`use_model()`/`link_model()` functions. This is formally a breaking change.

## Added
- `wandb agent` and `wandb.agent()` now accept a `forward_signals` flag (CLI: `--forward-signals/-f`) to relay SIGINT/SIGTERM and other catchable signals from the agent to its sweep child runs, enabling cleaner shutdowns when you interrupt an agent process.
- `wandb beta sync` now supports a `--live` option for syncing a run while it's being logged.

## Removed
- Removed the deprecated `wandb.beta.workflows` module, including its `log_model()`, `use_model()`, and `link_model()` functions, and whose modern successors are the `Run.log_artifact`, `Run.use_artifact`, and `Run.link_artifact` methods, respectively.

## Fixed
- Fixed `Run.__exit__` type annotations to accept `None` values, which are passed when no exception is raised.
- Fixed `Invalid Client ID digest` error when creating artifacts after calling `random.seed()`. Client IDs could collide when random state was seeded deterministically..
- Fixed CLI error when listing empty artifacts.
- Fixed regression for calling `api.run()` on a Sweeps run.
- Fixed the "View run at" message printed at the end of a run which sometimes did not include a URL.
- Runs queried from wandb.Api() now display a string representation in VSCode notebooks instead of a broken HTML window.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.23.1" description="December 2, 2025">
## Added

- Regex support in metrics and run overview filters in `wandb beta leet` command.
- Chart inspection in `wandb beta leet` command: right-click and drag to show (x, y) at the nearest data point; hold Alt for synchronized inspection across all visible charts.
- The Automations API now supports creating and editing automations that trigger on run states.
- The Automations API now supports basic zscore automation events.
- `beta_history_scan` method to `Run` objects for faster history scanning performance with `wandb.Api`.

## Changed

- `wandb.Api()` now raises a `UsageError` if `WANDB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` is set and an explicit API key is not provided.

## Deprecated

- Anonymous mode is deprecated and will emit warnings. This deprecation includes the `anonymous` setting, the `WANDB_ANONYMOUS` environment variable, `wandb.init(anonymous=...)`, and commands `wandb login --anonymously` and `wandb.login(anonymous=...)`.

## Fixed

- `wandb.Image()` no longer prints a deprecation warning.
- `Registry.description` and `ArtifactCollection.description` no longer reject empty strings.
- Instantiating `Artifact` objects is now significantly faster.
- `wandb.Run.save()` now falls back to hardlinks and, if needed, copying (downgrading the 'live' file policy to 'now', if applicable) when symlinks are disabled or unavailable (e.g., cross‑volume or no Developer Mode on Windows).
- Artifact collection aliases are now fetched lazily on accessing `ArtifactCollection.aliases` instead of on instantiating `ArtifactCollection`, improving performance of `Api.artifact_collections()`, `Api.registries().collections()`, etc.
- Use explicitly provided API key in `wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(api_key="..."))` for login. Use the key from run when logging artifacts via `run.log_artifact`.
- W&B LEET TUI correctly displays negative Y axis tick values and base/display units of certain system metrics.
- Fixed a rare infinite loop in `console_capture.py`.
- File upload/download now respects `WANDB_X_EXTRA_HTTP_HEADERS` except for [reference artifacts](/models/artifacts/track-external-files).
</Update>

<Update label="v0.23.0" description="November 11, 2025">
## Added

- Experimental `wandb beta leet` command - Lightweight Experiment Exploration Tool - a terminal UI for viewing W&B runs locally with real-time metrics visualization and system monitoring.
- The registry API now supports programmatic management of user and team members of individual registries.
- `Registry.id` has been added as a (read-only) property of `Registry` objects.

## Fixed

- `Artifact.files()` now has a correct `len()` when filtering by the `names` parameter.
- The numerator for file upload progress no longer occasionally exceeds the total file size.
- `Artifact.link()` now logs unsaved artifacts instead of raising an error, consistent with the behavior of `Run.link_artifact()`.
- Automatic code saving now works when running ipython notebooks in VSCode's Jupyter notebook extension.
- Logging an artifact with infinite floats in `Artifact.metadata` now raises a `ValueError` early, instead of waiting on request retries to time out.
</Update>

<Update label="v0.22.3" description="October 28, 2025">
## Added

- Settings `console_chunk_max_seconds` and `console_chunk_max_bytes` for size- and time-based multipart console logs file chunking.
- Registry API query methods (`Api.registries()`, `Registry.{collections,versions}()`, `Api.registries().{collections,versions}()`) now accept a `per_page` keyword arg to override the default batch size for paginated results.

## Changed

- API keys longer than 40 characters are now supported.

## Fixed

- `run.config` now properly returns a dict when calling `artifact.logged_by()` in v0.22.1.
- `wandb.Api(api_key=...)` now prioritizes the explicitly provided API key over thread-local cached credentials.
- Fixed a rare deadlock in `console_capture.py`.

    If you dump thread tracebacks during the deadlock and see the `wandb-AsyncioManager-main` thread stuck on a line in `console_capture.py`: this is now fixed.
- Fixed an issue where TensorBoard sync would sometimes stop working if the tfevents files were being written live.
- `Artifact.manifest` delays downloading **and** generating the download URL for the artifact manifest until it's first used. If the manifest has not been locally modified, `Artifact.size` and `Artifact.digest` can return without waiting to fetch the full manifest.
- Fixed uploading GCS folder references via `artifact.add_reference`.
- The SDK now correctly infers notebooks paths in Jupyter sessions, using th server's root directory, so code saving works in subdirectories (e.g. `code/nested/<notebook>.ipynb`).

</Update>

<Update label="v0.22.2" description="October 07, 2025">


## Fixed

- Possibly fixed some cases where the `output.log` file was not being uploaded.
- Fixed excessive data uploads when calling `run.save()` repeatedly on unchanged files.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.22.1" description="September 29, 2025">


## Added

- Optimize artifacts downloads re-verification with checksum caching.
- Lazy loading support for `Api().runs()` to improve performance when listing runs. The new `lazy=True` parameter (default) loads only essential metadata initially, with automatic on-demand loading of heavy fields like config and summary when accessed.
- Add `storage_region` option when creating artifacts. Users can use [CoreWeave AI Object Storage](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage) by specifying `wandb.Artifact(storage_region="coreweave-us")` when using wandb.ai for faster artifact upload/download on CoreWeave's infrastructure.


## Fixed

- `Api.artifact_exists()` and `Api.artifact_collection_exists()` now raise on encountering timeout errors, rather than (potentially erroneously) returning `False`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.22.0" description="September 18, 2025">


## Notable Changes

This version removes support of MacOS 10.

## Removed

- Remove a build targeting MacOS 10.x due to multiple security and supply chain considerations.

## Fixed

- Resuming a run with a different active run will now raise an error unless you call `run.finish()` first, or call `wandb.init()` with the parameter `reinit='create_new'`.
- Fix `Api().runs()` for wandb server &lt;  0.51.0 (when `project.internalId` was added to gql API).
- Sweeps: `command` run scripts that `import readline` whether directly or indirectly (e.g. `import torch` on Python 3.13) should no longer deadlock.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.21.4" description="September 11, 2025">


## Added

- Add DSPy integration: track evaluation metrics over time, log predictions and program signature evolution to W&B Tables, and save DSPy programs as W&B Artifacts (complete program or state as JSON/PKL).

</Update>

<Update label="v0.21.3" description="August 30, 2025">


## Changed

- Updated `click` dependency constraint from `>=7.1` to `>=8.0.1`.

## Fixed

- The message "Changes to your wandb environment variables will be ignored" is no longer printed when nothing changed.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.21.2" description="August 28, 2025">


## Notable Changes

This version raises errors that would previously have been suppressed during calls to `Artifact.link()` or `Run.link_artifact()`. While this prevents undetected failures in those methods, it is also a breaking change.

## Added

- New settings for `max_end_of_run_history_metrics` and `max_end_of_run_summary_metrics`.
- New `wandb.integration.weave` module for automatically initializing Weave when a W&B run is active and `weave` is imported.

## Changed

- Errors encountered while linking an artifact are no longer suppressed/silenced, and `Artifact.link()` and `Run.link_artifact()` no longer return `None`.
- The "Run history" and "Run summary" printed at the end of a run are now limited to 10 metrics each.

## Fixed

- Dataclasses in a run's `config` no long raise `Object of type ... is not JSON serializable` when containing real classes as fields to the dataclass.
- `Artifact.link()` and `Run.link_artifact()` should be faster on server versions 0.74.0+, requiring 4-5 fewer unnecessary blocking GraphQL requests.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.21.1" description="August 07, 2025">


## Notable Changes

The default ordering for `Api().runs(...)` and `Api().sweeps(...)` is now ascending order based on the runs `created_at` time.

## Added

- Support `first` summary option in `define_metric`.
- Add support for paginated sweeps.
- `pattern` parameter to `Api().run().files` to only get files matching a given pattern from the W&B backend.
- Add optional `format` key to Launch input JSONSchema to specify a string with a secret format.

## Changed

- `Sweep.name` property will now return user-edited display name if available (falling back to original name from sweep config, then sweep ID as before).
- `Api().runs(...)` and `Api().sweeps(...)` now returns runs in ascending order according to the runs `created_at` time.
- Artifact with large file (>2GB) uploads faster by using parallel hashing on system with more cores.
- Remove the implementation of `__bool__` for the registry iterators to align with python lazy iterators.

## Deprecated

- The `wandb.beta.workflows` module and its contents (including `log_model()`, `use_model()`, and `link_model()`) are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

## Fixed

- Correct the artifact url for organization registry artifacts to be independent of the artifact type.
- Suffixes on sanitized `InternalArtifact` names have been shortened to 6 alphanumeric characters.
- `wandb.Video` will not print a progress spinner while encoding video when `WANDB_SILENT`/`WANDB_QUIET` environment variables are set.
- Fixed registries fetched using `api.registries()` from having an extra `wandb-registry-` prefix in the name and full_name fields.
- Fixed a crash that could happen when using `sync_tensorboard`.
- `Api().run(...).upload_file` no longer throws an error when uploading a file in a different path relative to the provided root directory.
- Calling `load()` function on a public API run object no longer throws `TypeError`.
- When a Sweeps run function called by `wandb.agent()` API throws an exception, it will now appear on the logs page for the run. (This previously only happened for runs called by the `wandb agent` CLI command.).

</Update>

<Update label="v0.21.0" description="July 01, 2025">


## Notable Changes

This version removes the legacy implementation of the `service` process. This is a breaking change.

## Added

- Setting `x_stats_track_process_tree` to track process-specific metrics such as the RSS, CPU%, and thread count in use for the entire process tree, starting from `x_stats_pid`. This can be expensive and is disabled by default.
- Notes are now returned to the client when resuming a run.
- Added support for creating custom Vega chart presets through the API. Users can now define and upload custom chart specifications that can be then reused across runs with wandb.plot_table().

## Changed

- Calling `Artifact.link()` no longer instantiates a throwaway placeholder run.
- `wandb` now attempts to use Unix sockets for IPC instead of listening on localhost, making it work in environments with more restrictive permissions (such as Databricks).
- `Api.artifact()` will now display a warning while fetching artifacts from migrated model registry collections.
- The `.length` for objects queried from `wandb.Api` has been deprecated. Use `len(...)` instead.

## Removed

- Removed the legacy python implementation of the `service` process. The `legacy-service` option of `wandb.require` as well as the `x_require_legacy_service` and `x_disable_setproctitle` settings with the corresponding environment variables have been removed and will now raise an error if used.

- Removed the private `wandb.Run._metadata` attribute. To override the auto-detected CPU and GPU counts as well as the GPU type, please use the new settings `x_stats_{cpu_count,cpu_logical_count,gpu_count,gpu_type}`.

## Fixed

- Allow s3 style CoreWeave URIs for reference artifacts.
- Fixed rare bug that made Ctrl+C ineffective after logging large amounts of data.
- Respect `silent`, `quiet`, and `show_warnings` settings passed to a `Run` instance for warnings emitted by the service process.
- `api.Runs` no longer makes an API call for each run loaded from W&B.
- Correctly parse the `x_extra_http_headers` setting from the env variable.
- `.length` calls the W&B backend to load the length of objects when no data has been loaded rather than returning `None`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.20.1" description="June 04, 2025">


## Fixed

- `wandb.Image()` was broken in 0.20.0 when given NumPy arrays with values in the range [0, 1], now fixed.

- wandb.Table: Added new constructor param, `log_mode`, with options `"IMMUTABLE"` and `"MUTABLE"`. `IMMUTABLE` log mode (default) is existing behavior that only allows a table to be logged once. `MUTABLE` log mode allows the table to be logged again if it has been mutated. (@domphan-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9758)
- wandb.Table: Added a new `log_mode`, `"INCREMENTAL"`, which logs newly added table data incrementally. (@domphan-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9810)

View the [v0.20.1 changelog](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases/tag/v0.20.1) on GitHub.


</Update>

<Update label="v0.20.0" description="June 03, 2025">


## Notable Changes

This version removes the ability to disable the `service` process. This is a breaking change.

## Added

- Added `merge` parameter to `Artifact.add_dir` to allow overwrite of previously-added artifact files.
- Support for pytorch.tensor for `masks` and `boxes` parameters when creating a `wandb.Image` object.
- `sync_tensorboard` now supports syncing tfevents files stored in S3, GCS and Azure.
  - GCS paths use the format `gs://bucket/path/to/log/dir` and rely on application-default credentials, which can be configured using `gcloud auth application-default login`
  - S3 paths use the format `s3://bucket/path/to/log/dir` and rely on the default credentials set through `aws configure`
  - Azure paths use the format `az://account/container/path/to/log/dir` and the `az login` credentials, but also require the `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` environment variables to be set. Some other environment variables are supported as well, see [here](https://pkg.go.dev/gocloud.dev@v0.41.0/blob/azureblob#hdr-URLs).
- Added support for initializing some Media objects with `pathlib.Path`.
- New setting `x_skip_transaction_log` that allows to skip the transaction log. Note: Should be used with caution, as it removes the gurantees about recoverability.
- `normalize` parameter to `wandb.Image` initialization to normalize pixel values for Images initialized with a numpy array or pytorch tensor.

## Changed

- Various APIs now raise `TypeError` instead of `ValueError` or other generic errors when given an argument of the wrong type.
- Various Artifacts and Automations APIs now raise `CommError` instead of `ValueError` upon encountering server errors, so as to surface the server error message.
- `wandb.sdk.wandb_run.Run::save` method now requires the `glob_str` argument.

## Removed

- Removed support for disabling the `service` process. The `x_disable_service`/`_disable_service` setting and the `WANDB_DISABLE_SERVICE`/`WANDB_X_DISABLE_SERVICE` environment variable have been deprecated and will now raise an error if used.
- Removed ability to use `wandb.docker` after only importing `wandb`.
  - `wandb.docker` is not part of `wandb`'s public interface and is subject to breaking changes. Please do not use it.
- Removed no-op `sync` argument from `wandb.Run::log` function.
- Removed deprecated `wandb.sdk.wandb_run.Run.mode` property.
- Removed deprecated `wandb.sdk.wandb_run.Run::join` method.

## Deprecated

- The `start_method` setting is deprecated and has no effect; it is safely ignored.
- The property `Artifact.use_as` and parameter `use_as` for `run.use_artifact()` are deprecated since these have not been in use for W&B Launch.

## Fixed

- Calling `wandb.teardown()` in a child of a process that called `wandb.setup()` no longer raises `WandbServiceNotOwnedError`.
  - This error could have manifested when using W&B Sweeps
- Offline runs with requested branching (fork or rewind) sync correctly.
- Log exception as string when raising exception in Job wait_until_running method.
- `wandb.Image` initialized with tensorflow data would be normalized differently than when initialized with a numpy array.
- Using `wandb login` no longer prints a warning about `wandb.require("legacy-service")`.
- Logging a `Table` (or other objects that create internal artifacts) no longer raises `ValueError` when logged from a run whose ID contains special characters.
- `wandb.Api` initialized with the `base_url` now respects the provided url, rather than the last login url.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.11" description="May 07, 2025">


## Added

- Added creation, deletion, and updating of registries in the SDK.
- `artifact.is_link` property to artifacts to determine if an artifact is a link artifact (such as in the Registry) or source artifact.
- `artifact.linked_artifacts` to fetch all the linked artifacts to a source artifact and `artifact.source_artifact` to fetch the source artifact of a linked artifact.
- `run.link_artifact()`, `artifact.link()`, and `run.link_model()` all return the linked artifact upon linking.
- Multipart download for artifact file larger than 2GB, user can control it directly using `artifact.download(multipart=True)`.
- `Project.id` property to get the project ID on a `wandb.public.Project`.
- New public API for W&B Automations.
  - New submodules and classes in `wandb.automations.*` to support programmatically managing W&B Automations.
  - `Api.integrations()`, `Api.slack_integrations()`, `Api.webhook_integrations()` to fetch a team's existing Slack or webhook integrations.
  - `Api.create_automation()`, `Api.automation()`/`Api.automations()`, `Api.update_automation()`, `Api.delete_automation()` to create, fetch, edit, and delete Automations.
- Create and edit automations triggered on `RUN_METRIC_CHANGE` events, i.e. on changes in run metric values (absolute or relative deltas).
- Ability to collect profiling metrics for Nvidia GPUs using DCGM. To enable, set the `WANDB_ENABLE_DCGM_PROFILING` environment variable to `true`. Requires the `nvidia-dcgm` service to be running on the machine. Enabling this feature can lead to increased resource usage.


## Fixed

- `run.log_code` correctly sets the run configs `code_path` value.
- Correctly use `WANDB_CONFIG_DIR` for determining system settings file path.
- Prevent invalid `Artifact` and `ArtifactCollection` names (which would make them unloggable), explicitly raising a `ValueError` when attempting to assign an invalid name.
- Prevent pydantic `ConfigError` in Pydantic v1 environments from not calling `.model_rebuild()/.update_forward_refs()` on generated types with ForwardRef fields.
- `wandb.init()` no longer raises `Permission denied` error when the wandb directory is not writable or readable.
- Calling `file.delete()` on files queried via `api.Runs(...)` no longer raises `CommError`.
    - Bug introduced in 0.19.1

View the [v0.19.11 changelog](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases/tag/v0.19.11) on GitHub.


</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.10" description="April 22, 2025">


## Added

- The new `reinit="create_new"` setting causes `wandb.init()` to create a new run even if other runs are active, without finishing the other runs (in contrast to `reinit="finish_previous"`). This will eventually become the default.
- Added `Artifact.history_step` to return the nearest run step at which history metrics were logged for the artifact's source run.
- Added `data_is_not_path` flag to skip file checks when initializing `wandb.Html` with a sting that points to a file.

## Changed

- `Artifact.download()` no longer raises an error when using `WANDB_MODE=offline` or when an offline run exists.

## Removed

- Dropped the `-q` / `--quiet` argument to the `wandb` magic in IPython / Jupyter; use the `quiet` run setting instead.

## Deprecated

- The following `wandb.Run` methods are deprecated in favor of properties and will be removed in a future release (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8925):.
    - `run.project_name()` is deprecated in favor of `run.project`
    - `run.get_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.url`
    - `run.get_project_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.project_url`
    - `run.get_sweep_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.sweep_url`


## Fixed

- Fixed ValueError on Windows when running a W&B script from a different drive.
- Fix base_url setting was not provided to wandb.login.
- `wandb.Html()` no longer raises `IsADirectoryError` with a value that matched a directory on the users system.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.9" description="April 01, 2025">


## Added

- The `reinit` setting can be set to `"default"`.
- Added support for building artifact file download urls using the new url scheme, with artifact collection membership context.

## Changed

- Boolean values for the `reinit` setting are deprecated; use "return_previous" and "finish_previous" instead.
- The "wandb" logger is configured with `propagate=False` at import time, whereas it previously happened when starting a run. This may change the messages observed by the root logger in some workflows.
- Metaflow now requires `plum-dispatch` package.
- Relaxed the `pydantic` version requirement to support both v1 and v2.
- Existing `pydantic` types have been adapted to be compatible with Pydantic v1.
- `wandb.init(dir=...)` now creates any nonexistent directories in `dir` if it has a parent directory that is writeable.
- The server now supports fetching artifact files by providing additional collection information; updated the artifacts api to use the new endpoints instead.
- Paginated methods (and underlying paginators) that accept a `per_page` argument now only accept `int` values. Default `per_page` values are set directly in method signatures, and explicitly passing `None` is no longer supported.

## Fixed

- Calling `wandb.init()` in a notebook finishes previous runs as previously documented.
    - Bug introduced in 0.19.0
- Fixed an error being thrown when logging `jpg`/`jpeg` images containing transparency data.
- `wandb.init(resume_from=...)` now works without explicitly specifying the run's `id`.
- Deleting files with the Public API works again.
    - Bug introduced in 0.19.1
- Fixed media files not displaying in the UI when logging to a run with a custom storage bucket.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.8" description="March 04, 2025">


## Fixed

- Media file paths containing special characters (?, *, ], [ or \\) no longer cause file uploads to fail in `wandb-core`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.7" description="February 21, 2025">


## Added

- Registry search api.

## Changed

- Changed moviepy constraint to >=1.0.0.
- `wandb.init()` displays more detailed information, in particular when it is stuck retrying HTTP errors.

## Removed

- Removed the private `x_show_operation_stats` setting.

## Fixed

- Fixed incorrect logging of an "wandb.Video requires moviepy \[...\]" exception when using moviepy v2.
- `wandb.setup()` correctly starts up the internal service process; this semantic was unintentionally broken in 0.19.2.
- Fixed `TypeError: Object of type ... is not JSON serializable` when using numpy number types as values.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.6" description="February 05, 2025">


## Added

- Prometheus API support for Nvidia DCGM GPU metrics collection.

## Changed

- Changed Nvidia GPU ECC counters from aggregated to volatile.

## Fixed

- Fixed a performance issue causing slow instantiation of `wandb.Artifact`, which in turn slowed down fetching artifacts in various API methods.
- Some errors from `wandb.Api` have better string representations.
- Artifact.add_reference, when used with file URIs for a directory and the name parameter, was incorrectly adding the value of `name` to the path of the file references.
- Fixed a bug causing `Artifact.add_reference()` with `checksum=False` to log new versions of local reference artifacts without changes to the reference URI.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.5" description="January 29, 2025">


## Added

- Added `wandb login --base-url {host_url}` to login as an alias of `wandb login --host {host_url}`.

## Changed
- Temporarily disabled collecting per-core CPU utilization stats.

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug causing `offline` mode to make network requests when logging media artifacts. If you are using an older version of W&B Server that does not support offline artifact uploads, use the setting `allow_offline_artifacts=False` to revert to older compatible behavior.
- Expand sanitization rules for logged table artifact name to allow for hyphens and dots. This update brings the rules up-to-date with the current rules for artifact names. (Allowing letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots).
- Correctly handle run rewind settings `fork_from` and `resume_from`.

</Update>

<Update label="v0.19.4" description="January 16, 2025">


## Fixed
