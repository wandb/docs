# Migration Mapping Audit Report

## Executive Summary

After comparing the intended structure in `wandb/mintlifytest` with the actual structure in `wandb/docs` (mintlify-import branch), I found:

1. **One confirmed mapping error** (already fixed): `models_quickstart.mdx` was incorrectly placed in `models/` instead of `guides/`
2. **No other systemic mapping errors** were found
3. **Some intentional differences** exist between the two repos

## Detailed Findings

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **models_quickstart.mdx**
   - **Issue**: Incorrectly mapped from `content/en/guides/models_quickstart.md` to `models/models_quickstart.mdx`
   - **Correct location**: `guides/models_quickstart.mdx`
   - **Status**: Fixed in commit cdd862f1d

### üìä Structure Comparison

| Directory | mintlifytest | docs | Status |
|-----------|-------------|------|--------|
| guides/ | 70 files | 70 files | ‚úÖ Match (after fix) |
| models/ | 476 files | 476 files | ‚úÖ Match |
| platform/ | Present | Present | ‚úÖ Match |
| tutorials/ | Present | Present | ‚úÖ Match |
| weave/ | Present | Present | ‚úÖ Match |

### üìù Intentional Differences

#### Files only in docs (not in mintlifytest):
- `blog.mdx` - Blog landing page
- `courses.mdx` - Courses page
- `get-started.mdx` - Getting started guide
- `pricing.mdx` - Pricing information
- `release-notes/server-releases.mdx` - Server release notes
- `release-notes/server-releases-archived.mdx` - Archived server releases
- `security.mdx` - Security redirect page (different from `models/support/security.mdx`)

These appear to be additional content added after the mintlifytest snapshot or specific to the production docs.

#### Files only in mintlifytest (missing from docs):
- Various release notes files (`release-notes/0.60.0.mdx` through `release-notes/0.74.mdx`)
- Some platform navigation files (`platform/hosting/data-security.mdx`, etc.)

These may have been intentionally excluded or reorganized during the final migration.

## Conclusion

The migration script had **one specific bug** that misplaced `models_quickstart.mdx`. This has been corrected. No other systematic mapping errors were found. The differences between the repos appear to be intentional content organization decisions rather than migration script errors.

## Recommendations

1. **No further file moves needed** - The structure now matches the intended organization
2. **Verify navigation** - Ensure `docs.json` properly references `guides/models_quickstart.mdx`
3. **Document the differences** - The intentional differences between mintlifytest and production should be documented for future reference

## Migration Script Bug Pattern

The bug appears to be that the script incorrectly assumed files with "models" in their name should go to the `models/` directory:
- `content/en/guides/models_quickstart.md` ‚Üí `models/models_quickstart.mdx` ‚ùå
- `content/en/guides/quickstart.md` ‚Üí `models/quickstart.mdx` ‚úÖ

This was likely a pattern matching issue in the migration script rather than a systemic problem.
