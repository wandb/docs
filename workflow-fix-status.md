# Workflow Fix Status - September 9, 2025

## Current State

### What We've Done
1. ✅ Identified 4 issues in the HTML preview workflow:
   - Added files not linked
   - Include files not showing dependent pages
   - Modified index files not linked
   - Deleted files incorrectly showing links

2. ✅ Implemented fixes:
   - Checkout PR branch at workflow level (`ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`)
   - Added fallback URL construction for new files not in pageurls.json
   - Fixed include file path construction
   - Added special handling for _index.md files
   - Added isDeleted flag to prevent links on deleted files

3. ✅ Created patches:
   - `final-production-clean.patch` - Clean fixes only (ready for main repo PR)
   - `temporary-override-only.patch` - Just the Cloudflare URL override
   - `updated-testing-version-with-override.patch` - Fixes + override combined

### Current Situation
- Fork's main branch has the fixes BUT NOT the override (because Cloudflare doesn't build in forks)
- PR #3 in fork is running workflow without the override, so it won't show links
- We need to apply the override to make testing work

## Next Steps (for tomorrow)

### 1. Apply Override to Fork's Main
```bash
cd mdlinville/docs
git checkout main
git apply temporary-override-only.patch
git commit -m "Add temporary Cloudflare override for testing"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update PR #3
Merge the updated main (with override) into PR #3's branch to trigger new workflow run

### 3. Validate Results
Check that PR #3's preview comment shows:
- ✅ Added files WITH links (e.g., `new-test-file.md` → `https://1607.docs-14y.pages.dev/guides/ai/new-test-file/`)
- ✅ Modified files WITH links (e.g., `_index.md` → `https://1607.docs-14y.pages.dev/`)
- ✅ Deleted files WITHOUT links
- ✅ Include files listed (if any)

### 4A. If Success → Create Production PR
Use `final-production-clean.patch` to create PR in wandb/docs:
```bash
cd wandb/docs
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix-preview-workflow-issues
git apply final-production-clean.patch
git push origin fix-preview-workflow-issues
# Create PR
```

### 4B. If Issues → Iterate in Fork
- Debug what's wrong
- Update fixes in fork's main
- Re-test in PR #3
- Repeat until working

## Key Files
- `/workspace/final-production-clean.patch` - Ready for production PR (no overrides)
- `/workspace/temporary-override-only.patch` - Just the override for fork testing
- `/workspace/workflow-fix-status.md` - This status file

## Important Context
- Cloudflare doesn't build in forks, hence the need for the hardcoded override
- The override uses PR #1607's preview URL: `https://1607.docs-14y.pages.dev`
- The fixes handle new files by constructing URLs when they're not in pageurls.json
