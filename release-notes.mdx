We have two channels for release notes, each with their own RSS feeds.

<Card 
  title="Release notes for supported W&B Server releases" 
  href="./release-notes/server-releases"
  icon="rss"
/>

<Card 
  title="Historical release notes for archived W&B Server releases" 
  href="./release-notes/server-releases-archived"
  icon="rss"
/>
In addition, you can view [details about Weights & Biases' release policies](./release-notes/release-policies).
