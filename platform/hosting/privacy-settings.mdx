title: Configure privacy settings
---

Organization and Team admins can configure a set of privacy settings at the organization and team scopes respectively. When configured at the organization scope, organization admins enforce those settings for all teams in that organization.

<Note>
W&B recommends organization admins to enforce a privacy setting only after communicating that in advance to all team admins and users in their organization. This is to avoid unexpected changes in their workflows.

## Configure privacy settings for a team

Team admins can configure privacy settings for their respective teams from within the `Privacy` section of the team **Settings** tab. Each setting is configurable as long as it's not enforced at the organization scope:

* **Hide this team from all non-members** - Prevents the team from being visible to users who are not members
* **Make all future team projects private** - Ensures all new projects created in the team are private (public sharing not allowed)
* **Allow any team member to invite other members** - Enables all team members to invite new members, not just admins
* **Turn off public sharing for reports in private projects** - Disables public sharing of reports and deactivates existing magic links
* **Allow users with matching organization email domain to join this team** - Permits automatic team joining for users with the same email domain
  <Note>This setting is only available in [Multi-tenant Cloud](./hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) deployments.</Note>
* **Enable code saving by default** - Automatically saves code for all runs in the team

## Enforce privacy settings for all teams

Organization admins can enforce privacy settings for all teams in their organization from within the `Privacy` section of the **Settings** tab in the account or organization dashboard. If organization admins enforce a setting, team admins are not allowed to configure that within their respective teams.

* **Enforce team visibility restrictions** - Hides all teams from non-members across the organization
* **Enforce privacy for future projects** - Requires all new projects in all teams to be private or [restricted](./iam/access-management/restricted-projects)
* **Enforce invitation control** - Prevents non-admins from inviting members to any team
* **Enforce report sharing control** - Turns off public sharing of reports in private projects and deactivates existing magic links
* **Enforce team self-joining restrictions** - Restricts users with matching organization email domain from automatically joining any team
  <Note>This setting is only available in [Multi-tenant Cloud](./hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) deployments.</Note>
* **Enforce default code saving restrictions** - Turns off code saving by default for all teams
