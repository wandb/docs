<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.
</Note>

This guide provides instructions for deploying W&B Platform on on-premises Kubernetes infrastructure, including datacenter and private cloud environments.

For air-gapped or fully disconnected environments, see the [Deploy on Air-Gapped Kubernetes](/platform/hosting/self-managed/on-premises-deployments/kubernetes-airgapped) guide.

Reach out to the W&B [Sales](mailto:contact@wandb.com) to learn more.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying W&B on your on-premises Kubernetes infrastructure, ensure your environment meets all requirements. For complete details, see the [Requirements](/platform/hosting/self-managed/requirements) page, which covers:

- Kubernetes cluster requirements (versions, ingress, persistent volumes)
- MySQL database configuration
- Redis requirements
- Object storage setup
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Networking and load balancer configuration
- Hardware sizing recommendations

Additionally, refer to the [Reference Architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch) for infrastructure guidelines and best practices.

### Object storage provisioning

W&B requires S3-compatible object storage. For detailed provisioning instructions for various storage providers, see:

<ByobProvisioningLink/>

After provisioning your object storage, you'll configure it in the W&B Custom Resource as described in the deployment steps below.

## Deploy W&B with the Kubernetes Operator

The recommended method for deploying W&B on Kubernetes is using the **W&B Kubernetes Operator**. The operator manages the W&B platform components and simplifies deployment, updates, and maintenance.

### Choose your deployment method

The W&B Operator can be deployed using two methods:

1. **Helm CLI** - Direct deployment using Helm commands
2. **Terraform** - Infrastructure-as-code deployment using Terraform

For complete deployment instructions, including step-by-step guides for both methods, see [Deploy W&B with Kubernetes Operator](/platform/hosting/self-managed/operator).

The operator guide covers:
- Installing the operator
- Configuring the W&B Custom Resource (CR)
- Object storage configuration
- MySQL and Redis connection settings
- SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- Ingress and networking setup
- Updates and maintenance

### On-premises specific considerations

When deploying on on-premises infrastructure, pay special attention to the following:

#### Load balancer configuration

On-premises Kubernetes clusters typically require manual load balancer configuration. Options include:

- **External load balancer**: Configure an existing hardware or software load balancer (F5, HAProxy, etc.)
- **Nginx Ingress Controller**: Deploy nginx-ingress-controller with NodePort or host networking
- **MetalLB**: For bare-metal Kubernetes clusters, MetalLB provides load balancer services

For detailed load balancer configuration examples, see the [Reference Architecture networking section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch#networking).

#### Persistent storage

Ensure your Kubernetes cluster has a StorageClass configured for persistent volumes. W&B components may require persistent storage for caching and temporary data.

Common on-premises storage options:
- NFS-based storage classes
- Ceph/Rook storage
- Local persistent volumes
- Enterprise storage solutions (NetApp, Pure Storage, etc.)

#### DNS and certificate management

For on-premises deployments:
- Configure internal DNS records to point to your W&B hostname
- Provision SSL/TLS certificates from your internal Certificate Authority (CA)
- If using self-signed certificates, configure the operator to trust your CA certificate

See the [SSL/TLS requirements](/platform/hosting/self-managed/requirements#ssl-tls) for certificate configuration details.

### OpenShift deployments

W&B fully supports deployment on OpenShift Kubernetes clusters. OpenShift deployments require additional security context configurations due to OpenShift's stricter security policies.

For OpenShift-specific configuration details, see:
- [Operator guide OpenShift section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/operator#openshift-kubernetes-clusters)
- [Deploy on Air-Gapped Kubernetes](/platform/hosting/self-managed/on-premises-deployments/kubernetes-airgapped#openshift-configuration) for comprehensive OpenShift examples

## Object storage configuration

After provisioning your object storage bucket (see [Prerequisites](#object-storage-provisioning) above), configure it in your W&B Custom Resource.

### AWS S3 (on-premises)

For on-premises AWS S3 (via Outposts or compatible storage):

```yaml
bucket:
  kmsKey: <kms key arn>  # Optional KMS key for encryption
  name: <bucket name>    # Example: wandb
  path: ""               # Keep as empty string
  provider: s3
  region: <region>       # Example: us-east-1
```

### S3-compatible storage (MinIO, Ceph, NetApp, etc.)

For S3-compatible storage systems:

```yaml
bucket:
  kmsKey: null
  name: <s3 endpoint>    # Example: s3.example.com:9000
  path: <bucket name>    # Example: wandb
  provider: s3
  region: <region>       # Example: us-east-1
```

To enable TLS for S3-compatible storage, append `?tls=true` to the bucket path:

```yaml
bucket:
  path: "wandb?tls=true"
```

<Warning>
The certificate must be trusted. Self-signed certificates require additional configuration. See the [SSL/TLS requirements](/platform/hosting/self-managed/requirements#ssl-tls) for details.
</Warning>

### Important considerations for on-premises object storage

When running your own object storage, consider:

1. **Storage capacity and performance**: Monitor disk capacity carefully. Average W&B usage results in tens to hundreds of gigabytes. Heavy usage could result in petabytes of storage consumption.
2. **Fault tolerance**: At minimum, use RAID arrays for physical disks. For S3-compatible storage, use distributed or highly available configurations.
3. **Availability**: Configure monitoring to ensure the storage remains available.

### MinIO considerations

<Warning>
MinIO Open Source is in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/minio/minio) with no active development. Pre-compiled binaries are no longer provided, and only critical security fixes are considered case-by-case. For production deployments, W&B recommends using managed object storage services or [MinIO Enterprise (AIStor)](https://min.io/product/aistor).
</Warning>

Enterprise alternatives for on-premises object storage include:
- [Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/outposts/)
- [NetApp StorageGRID](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid/)
- MinIO Enterprise (AIStor)
- [Dell ObjectScale](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/sf/objectscale)

If you are using an existing MinIO deployment or MinIO Enterprise, you can create a bucket using the MinIO client:

```bash
mc config host add local http://$MINIO_HOST:$MINIO_PORT "$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY" "$MINIO_SECRET_KEY" --api s3v4
mc mb --region=us-east-1 local/wandb-files
```

## Verify your installation

After deploying W&B, verify the installation is working correctly:

<SelfManagedVerifyInstallation/>

## Next steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Configure user authentication**: Set up [SSO](/platform/hosting/iam/sso) or other authentication methods
2. **Set up monitoring**: Configure monitoring for your W&B instance and infrastructure
3. **Plan for updates**: Review the [Server upgrade process](/platform/hosting/server-upgrade-process) and establish an update cadence
4. **Configure backups**: Establish backup procedures for your MySQL database

## Getting help
