<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.

## Infrastructure guidelines

Before you start deploying W&B, refer to the [reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#infrastructure-requirements) for complete infrastructure requirements, including hardware sizing recommendations.

### Version Requirements
<SelfManagedVersionRequirements/>

### Hardware Requirements

<SelfManagedHardwareRequirements/>

## MySQL database

<SelfManagedMysqlRequirements/>

For MySQL version requirements, see the [Version Requirements](#version-requirements) section above.

For MySQL configuration parameters for self-managed instances, see the [reference architecture MySQL configuration section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#mysql-configuration-parameters).

### Database creation

<SelfManagedMysqlDatabaseCreation/>

<Note>
For SSL/TLS certificate requirements, see the [SSL/TLS section](#ssl-tls) below.
</Note>

## Redis

## Object storage

<SelfManagedObjectStorageRequirements/>

### Self-hosted object storage setup

The object store can be externally hosted on a [Minio cluster](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/index.html), or any Amazon S3 compatible object store that has support for signed URLs. Run the [following script](https://gist.github.com/vanpelt/2e018f7313dabf7cca15ad66c2dd9c5b) to check if your object store supports signed URLs.

Additionally, the following CORS policy needs to be applied to the object store.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>http://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-IP</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

You can specify your credentials in a connection string when you connect to an Amazon S3 compatible object store. For example, you can specify the following: 

```yaml
s3://$ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY@$HOST/$BUCKET_NAME
```

You can optionally tell W&B to only connect over TLS if you configure a trusted SSL certificate for your object store. To do so, add the `tls` query parameter to the URL. For example, the following URL example demonstrates how to add the TLS query parameter to an Amazon S3 URI:

```yaml
s3://$ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY@$HOST/$BUCKET_NAME?tls=true
```

<Warning>
For SSL/TLS certificate requirements, see the [SSL/TLS section](#ssl-tls) below.
</Warning>

Set `BUCKET_QUEUE` to `internal://` if you use third-party object stores. This tells the W&B server to manage all object notifications internally instead of depending on an external SQS queue or equivalent.

The most important things to consider when running your own object store are:

1. **Storage capacity and performance**. It's fine to use magnetic disks, but you should be monitoring the capacity of these disks. Average W&B usage results in 10's to 100's of Gigabytes. Heavy usage could result in Petabytes of storage consumption.
2. **Fault tolerance.** At a minimum, the physical disk storing the objects should be on a RAID array. If you use minio, consider running it in [distributed mode](https://min.io/docs/minio/kubernetes/upstream/operations/concepts/availability-and-resiliency.html#distributed-minio-deployments).
3. **Availability.** Monitoring should be configured to ensure the storage is available.

There are many enterprise alternatives to running your own object storage service such as:

1. [Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/outposts/)
2. [NetApp StorageGRID](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid/)

### MinIO set up

If you use minio, you can run the following commands to create a bucket.

```bash
mc config host add local http://$MINIO_HOST:$MINIO_PORT "$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY" "$MINIO_SECRET_KEY" --api s3v4
mc mb --region=us-east1 local/local-files
```

## Deploy W&B Server application to Kubernetes

The recommended installation method is using the **W&B Kubernetes Operator**, deployed via Helm.

For complete installation instructions, see [Run W&B Server on Kubernetes (Operator)](/platform/hosting/operator/), which covers:
- Helm CLI deployment
- Helm Terraform Module deployment  
- W&B Cloud Terraform modules

The sections below highlight considerations specific to on-premises/datacenter deployments.

### OpenShift

W&B supports deployment on OpenShift Kubernetes clusters in on-premises environments. See the [reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#kubernetes) for more details and the [Operator guide OpenShift section](/platform/hosting/operator/#openshift-kubernetes-clusters) for specific configuration instructions that you can adapt for your on-premises OpenShift deployment.

## Networking

For networking requirements, load balancer options, and configuration examples (including nginx), see the [reference architecture networking sections](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#networking).
