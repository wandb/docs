<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud/) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.

## Infrastructure guidelines

Before you start deploying W&B, refer to the [reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#infrastructure-requirements) for complete infrastructure requirements, including hardware sizing recommendations.

### Version Requirements
<SelfManagedVersionRequirements/>

### Hardware Requirements

<SelfManagedHardwareRequirements/>

## MySQL database

<SelfManagedMysqlRequirements/>

For MySQL version requirements, see the [Version Requirements](#version-requirements) section above.

For MySQL configuration parameters for self-managed instances, see the [reference architecture MySQL configuration section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#mysql-configuration-parameters).

### Database creation

<SelfManagedMysqlDatabaseCreation/>

<Note>
For SSL/TLS certificate requirements, see the [SSL/TLS section](#ssl-tls) below.
</Note>

## Redis

<SelfManagedRedisRequirements/>

## Object storage

<SelfManagedObjectStorageRequirements/>

### Self-hosted object storage setup

The object store can be externally hosted on any Amazon S3 compatible object store that has support for signed URLs. Run the [following script](https://gist.github.com/vanpelt/2e018f7313dabf7cca15ad66c2dd9c5b) to check if your object store supports signed URLs. See the [MinIO setup section](#minio-setup) below for important information about MinIO Open Source status.

Additionally, the following CORS policy needs to be applied to the object store.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>http://YOUR-W&B-SERVER-IP</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Configure object storage through the [System Console](/platform/hosting/iam/sso#system-console) or directly in the W&B Custom Resource (CR) specification.

#### AWS S3 configuration

For AWS S3 buckets, configure the following in your W&B CR:

```yaml
bucket:
  kmsKey: <kms key arn>  # Optional KMS key for encryption
  name: <bucket name>    # Example: wandb
  path: ""               # Keep as empty string
  provider: s3
  region: <region>       # Example: us-east-1
```

TLS is enabled by default for AWS S3 connections.

#### S3-compatible storage configuration

For S3-compatible storage (such as MinIO), use the following configuration:

```yaml
bucket:
  kmsKey: null
  name: <s3 endpoint>    # Example: s3.example.com:9000
  path: <bucket name>    # Example: wandb
  provider: s3
  region: <region>       # Example: us-east-1
```

To use TLS for S3-compatible storage, append `?tls=true` to the bucket path:

```yaml
bucket:
  kmsKey: null
  name: "s3.example.com:9000"
  path: "wandb?tls=true"
  provider: "s3"
  region: "us-east-1"
```

<Warning>
For certificate requirements, see the [SSL/TLS section](#ssl-tls) section below. The certificate must be trusted. Self-signed certificates require additional configuration.
</Warning>

The most important things to consider when running your own object store are:

1. **Storage capacity and performance**. It's fine to use magnetic disks, but you should be monitoring the capacity of these disks. Average W&B usage results in 10's to 100's of Gigabytes. Heavy usage could result in Petabytes of storage consumption.
2. **Fault tolerance.** At a minimum, the physical disk storing the objects should be on a RAID array. If you use S3-compatible storage, consider using a distributed or highly available configuration.
3. **Availability.** Monitoring should be configured to ensure the storage is available.

There are many enterprise alternatives to running your own object storage service such as:

1. [Amazon S3 on Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/outposts/)
2. [NetApp StorageGRID](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid/)

### MinIO setup

<Warning>
MinIO Open Source is in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/minio/minio) with no active development. Pre-compiled binaries are no longer provided, and only critical security fixes are considered case-by-case. For production deployments, W&B recommends using managed object storage services or [MinIO Enterprise (AIStor)](https://min.io/product/aistor).
</Warning>

If you are using an existing MinIO deployment or MinIO Enterprise, you can create a bucket using the MinIO client:

```bash
mc config host add local http://$MINIO_HOST:$MINIO_PORT "$MINIO_ACCESS_KEY" "$MINIO_SECRET_KEY" --api s3v4
mc mb --region=us-east1 local/local-files
```

For new deployments, consider enterprise alternatives listed above or managed cloud object storage services.

## Deploy W&B Server application to Kubernetes

The recommended installation method is using the **W&B Kubernetes Operator**, deployed via Helm.

For complete installation instructions, see [Run W&B Server on Kubernetes (Operator)](/platform/hosting/operator/), which covers:
- Helm CLI deployment
- Helm Terraform Module deployment  
- W&B Cloud Terraform modules

The sections below highlight considerations specific to on-premises/datacenter deployments.

### OpenShift

W&B supports deployment on OpenShift Kubernetes clusters in on-premises environments. See the [reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#kubernetes) for more details and the [Operator guide OpenShift section](/platform/hosting/operator/#openshift-kubernetes-clusters) for specific configuration instructions that you can adapt for your on-premises OpenShift deployment.

## Networking

For networking requirements, load balancer options, and configuration examples (including nginx), see the [reference architecture networking sections](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#networking).
