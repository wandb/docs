import RateLimitsDefaultsAndNotification from "/snippets/en/_includes/rate-limits-defaults-and-notification.mdx";

You can configure rate limits on your W&B Self-Managed instance to maintain stability and prevent one user or workload from negatively impacting others. These limits are optional. If you do not set them, the instance does not enforce the limits described below.

## Default limits and notification

<RateLimitsDefaultsAndNotification />

These defaults are recommended for typical production workloads. If your workloads consistently exceed these limits, you can configure these limits (or leave them unset) according to your instance size and shared usage. For configuration details, refer to [Deploy W&B with Kubernetes Operator](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed/operator) or contact [W&B support](mailto:support@wandb.com).
