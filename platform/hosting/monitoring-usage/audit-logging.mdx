title: Track user activity with audit logs
---

Use W&B audit logs to track user activity within your organization and to conform to your enterprise governance requirements. Audit logs are available in JSON format. Refer to [Audit log schema](#audit-log-schema).

How to access audit logs depends on your W&B platform deployment type:

| W&B Platform Deployment type | Audit logs access mechanism |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud) | <ul><li>[Instance-level BYOB](/platform/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector): Synced to instance-level bucket (BYOB) every 10 minutes. Also available using [the API](#fetch-audit-logs-using-api).</li><li>Default instance-level storage: Available only by using [the API](#fetch-audit-logs-using-api).</li></ul> |
| [Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud) | Available for Enterprise plans only. Available only by using [the API](#fetch-audit-logs-using-api). |
| [Self-Managed](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed) | Synced to instance-level bucket every 10 minutes. Also available using [the API](#fetch-audit-logs-using-api). |

After fetching audit logs, you can analyze them using tools like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), or [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric). Some audit log analysis tools do not support JSON; refer to the documentation for your analysis tool for guidelines and requirements for transforming the JSON-formatted audit logs before analysis.

For more details about the format of the logs, see [Audit log schema](#audit-log-schema) and [Actions](#actions).

## Audit log retention
- If you require audit logs to be retained for a specific period of time, W&B recommends periodically transferring logs to long-term storage, either using storage buckets or the Audit Logging API.
- If you are subject to the [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html), audit logs must be retained for a minimum of 6 years in an environment where they cannot be deleted or modified by any internal or exterrnal actor before the end of the mandatory retention period. For HIPAA-compliant [Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud) instances with [BYOB](/platform/hosting/data-security/secure-storage-connector), you must configure guardrails for your managed storage, including any long-term retention storage.

## Audit log schema
This table shows all keys which may appear in an audit log entry, ordered alphabetically. Depending on the action and the circumstances, a specific log entry may include only a subset of the possible fields.

| Key | Definition |
|---------| -------|
|`action`                  | The [action](#actions) of the event.

|`timestamp`               | The time of the event in [RFC3339 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339). For example, `2023-01-23T12:34:56Z` represents January 23, 2023 at 12:34:56 UTC.
|`user_asset`              | The user asset the action impacts (rather than the user performing the action), if applicable.
|`user_email`              | The email address of the user the action impacts (rather than the email address of the user performing the action), if applicable.

### Personally identifiable information (PII)

Personally identifiable information (PII), such as email addresses and the names of projects, teams, and reports, is available only using the API endpoint option.
- For [Self-Managed](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed) and 
  [Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud), an organization admin can [exclude PII](#exclude-pii) when fetching audit logs.
- For [Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud), the API endpoint always returns relevant fields for audit logs, including PII. This is not configurable.

## Before you begin
1. Organization level admins can fetch audit logs. If you receive a `403` error, ensure that you or your service account has adequate permission.
1. **Multi-tenant Cloud**: If you are a member of multiple Multi-tenant Cloud organizations, you _must_ configure the **Default API organization**, which determines where audit logging API calls are routed. Otherwise, you will receive the following error:
     ```text
     user is associated with multiple organizations but no valid org ID found in user info
     ```
     To specify your default API organization:
     1. Click your profile image, then click **User Settings**.
     1. For **Default API organization**, select an organization.

     This is not applicable to a service account, which can be a member of only one Multi-tenant Cloud organization.

## Fetch audit logs
To fetch audit logs:

1. Determine the correct API endpoint for your instance:

- [Self-Managed](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed): `<wandb-platform-url>/admin/audit_logs`
- [Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud): `<instance-name>.wandb.io/admin/audit_logs`
- [Multi-tenant Cloud (Enterprise required)](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud): `https://api.wandb.ai/audit_logs`

    In the following steps, replace `<API-endpoint>` with your API endpoint.
1. (Optional) Construct query parameters to append to the endpoint. In the following steps, replace `<parameters>` with the resulting string.
    - `anonymize`: if the URL includes the parameter `anonymize=true`, remove any PII. Otherwise, PII is included. Refer to [Exclude PII when fetching audit logs](#exclude-pii-when-fetching-audit-logs). Not supported for Multi-tenant Cloud, where all fields are included, including PII.
    - Configure the date window of logs to fetch using a combination of `numdays` and `startDate`. Each parameter is optional, and they interact.
      - If neither parameter is included, only today's logs are fetched.
      - `numDays`: An integer indicating the number of days backward from `startDate` to fetch logs. If it is omitted or set to `0`, logs are fetched for `startDate` only. **Multi-tenant Cloud** organizations can fetch up to 7 days of audit logs. In other words, if you set `numDays=9`, the effective parameter is `numDays=7`.
      - `startDate`: Controls the newest logs to fetch, in the format `startDate=YYYY-MM-DD`. If it is omitted or explicitly set to today's date, logs are fetched from today to `numDays` (up to `7` for Multi-tenant Cloud).
1. Construct the fully qualified endpoint URL in the format `<API-endpoint>?<parameters>`.
1. Execute an HTTP `GET` request on the fully qualified API endpoint using a web browser or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), or cURL.

The API response contains new-line separated JSON objects. Objects will include the fields described in the [schema](#audit-log-schema), just like when audit logs are synced to an instance-level bucket. In those cases, the audit logs are located in the `/wandb-audit-logs` directory in your bucket.

### Use basic authentication
To use basic authentication with your API key to access the audit logs API, set the HTTP request's `Authorization` header to the string `Basic` followed by a space, then the base-64 encoded string in the format `username:API-KEY`. In other words, replace the username and API key with your values separated with a `:` character, then base-64-encode the result. For example, to authorize as `demo:p@55w0rd`, the header should be `Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA==`.

### Exclude PII when fetching audit logs <a id="exclude-pii"></a>
For [Self-Managed](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed) and [Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud), a W&B organization or instance admin can exclude PII when fetching audit logs. For [Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/saas_cloud), the API endpoint always returns relevant fields for audit logs, including PII. This is not configurable.


To exclude PII, pass the `anonymize=true` URL parameter. For example, if your W&B instance URL is `https://mycompany.wandb.io` and you would like to get audit logs for user activity within the last week and exclude PII, use an API endpoint like:

```text
https://mycompany.wandb.io/admin/audit_logs?anonymize=true&<additional-parameters>.
```
