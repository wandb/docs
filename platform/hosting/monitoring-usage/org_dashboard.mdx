This page describes how to view activity in your W&B organization. Select your deployment type to continue.

## View user status and activity

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Dedicated Cloud / Self-Managed">
1. Navigate to the **Organization Dashboard**:
   - **Dedicated Cloud**: `https://<org-name>.io/org/dashboard/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name.
   - **Self-Managed**: `https://<YOUR-W&B-SERVER-IP>/org/dashboard`. Replace `<YOUR-W&B-SERVER-IP>` with your deployment's IP address.

   The **Users** tab opens by default and lists every user in the organization.
2. To sort the list by user status, click the **Last Active** column header. Each user's status is one of the following:
   * **Invite pending**: An invitation was sent but not yet accepted.
   * **A timestamp**: The user accepted the invitation and has signed in at least once. The timestamp indicates the most recent activity.
   * **Deactivated**: An admin revoked the user's access.
   * **No status**: Indicated by a hyphen. The user was previously active but has not been active in the last six months.
3. Hover over a user's **Last Active** field to see the date the user was added and their total active days.

A user is _active_ if they:
- sign in to W&B.
- open any page in the W&B App.
- log runs.
- use the SDK to track an experiment.
- interact with the W&B server in any way.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Multi-tenant Cloud">
1. Open the [**Members** page](https://wandb.ai/account-settings/wandb/members/). The table lists every user in your organization.
2. Click the **Last Active** column header to sort by user status. Each user's status is one of the following:
   * **A timestamp**: The user has signed in at least once. The timestamp indicates the most recent activity.
   * **No status**: Indicated by a hyphen. The user has not yet been active within the organization.

A user is _active_ if they perform any auditable action scoped to the organization after May 8 2025. For a full list, see [Actions](/platform/hosting/monitoring-usage/audit-logging#actions) in **Audit logging**.

To change the reporting period, use the drop-down above a plot. Options are Last 30 days, Last 3 months, Last 6 months, Last 12 months, and All time.
