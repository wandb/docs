## Use W&B Self-Managed on cloud or on-prem infrastructure

<Note>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.
</Note>

Deploy W&B Server on your [AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure cloud account](#deploy-wb-server-within-Self-Managed-cloud-accounts) or within your [on-premises infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure). 

Your IT/DevOps/MLOps team is responsible for:
- Provisioning your deployment.
- Securing your infrastructure in accordance with your organization's policies, [Security Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide), if applicable.
- Maintaining compliance with your organization's regulatory requirements, such as [Service and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) and [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html).
- Managing upgrades and applying patches.
- Continuously maintaining your W&B Self-Managed W&B deployment.

<Tip>
If your organization is subject to regulatory requirements, consider deploying on [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud.mdx), which is maintained by W&B.
- W&B Dedicated Cloud's hosting platform meets the requirements of SOC 2 Type 2.
- When configured appropriately, a W&B Dedicated Cloud deployment complies with HIPAA.

Refer to the [W&B Security Portal](https://security.wandb.ai/) to request more information.

## Deploy W&B Server within Self-Managed cloud accounts

W&B recommends that you use official W&B Terraform scripts to deploy W&B Server into your AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure cloud account.

See specific cloud provider documentation for more information on how to set up W&B Server in [AWS](/platform/hosting/self-managed/aws-tf), [Google Cloud](/platform/hosting/self-managed/gcp-tf), or [Azure](/platform/hosting/self-managed/azure-tf).

## Deploy W&B Server in on-prem infrastructure

To set up W&B Server in your on-premises infrastructure, you need to configure several infrastructure components. Some of those components include, but are not limited to: 

- (Strongly recommended) Kubernetes cluster
- MySQL 8 database cluster
- Amazon S3-compatible object storage
- Redis cache cluster

See [Install on on-prem infrastructure](/platform/hosting/self-managed/bare-metal) for detailed instructions to install W&B Server on your on-prem infrastructure. W&B can provide recommendations for the different components and provide guidance through the installation process.

## Deploy W&B Server on a custom cloud platform

You can deploy W&B Server to a cloud platform that is not AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Requirements for that are similar to that for deploying in [on-prem infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure).

## Obtain your W&B Server license

You need a W&B trial license to complete your configuration of the W&B server. Open the [Deploy Manager](https://deploy.wandb.ai/deploy) to generate a free trial license. 

<Note>
If you do not already have a W&B account, create one to generate your free license.

If you need an enterprise license for W&B Server which includes support for important security & other enterprise-friendly capabilities, [submit this form](https://wandb.ai/site/for-enterprise/self-hosted-trial) or reach out to your W&B team.
</Note>

The URL redirects you to a **Get a License for W&B Local** form. Provide the following information:

1. Choose a deployment type from the **Choose Platform** step.
2. Select the owner of the license or add a new organization in the **Basic Information** step.
3. Provide a name for the instance in the **Name of Instance** field and optionally provide a description in the **Description** field in the **Get a License** step.
4. Select the **Generate License Key** button.

A page displays with an overview of your deployment along with the license associated with the instance.
