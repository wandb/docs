<Tip>
W&B recommends fully managed deployment options such as [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/multi_tenant_cloud) or [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud) deployment types. W&B fully managed services are simple and secure to use, with minimum to no configuration required.
</Tip>

Deploy W&B Server on your [AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure cloud account](#deploy-wb-server-within-Self-Managed-cloud-accounts) or within your [on-premises infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure). 

Your IT/DevOps/MLOps team is responsible for:
- Provisioning your deployment.
- Securing your infrastructure in accordance with your organization's policies, [Security Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Technical_Implementation_Guide), if applicable.
- Maintaining compliance with your organization's regulatory requirements, such as [Service and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Type 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) and [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html).
- Managing upgrades and applying patches.
- Continuously maintaining your W&B Self-Managed W&B deployment.

<Info>
If your organization is subject to regulatory requirements, consider deploying on [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud.mdx), which is maintained by W&B.
- W&B Dedicated Cloud's hosting platform meets the requirements of SOC 2 Type 2.
- When configured appropriately, a W&B Dedicated Cloud deployment complies with HIPAA.

Refer to the [W&B Security Portal](https://security.wandb.ai/) to request more information.

## About the W&B Kubernetes Operator

Use the **W&B Kubernetes Operator** to deploy W&B Self-Managed. The operator simplifies deploying, administering, troubleshooting, and scaling W&B.

The operator connects to a central [deploy.wandb.ai](https://deploy.wandb.ai) server to request the latest specification changes for a given release channel and apply them. Updates are received as long as the license is valid. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is used both to install the operator and for the operator to manage the W&B Kubernetes stack. The deployment consists of multiple pods, one per service; each pod name is prefixed with `wandb-`.

Configuration follows a hierarchy: **Release Channel Values** (defaults from W&B), **User Input Values** (overrides via the System Console), and **Custom Resource Values** (your spec overrides both). For details, see [Deploy W&B with Kubernetes Operator](/platform/hosting/self-managed/operator).

- To deploy W&B Self-Managed in public cloud or on-premises infrastructure, see [Deploy W&B with Kubernetes Operator](/platform/hosting/self-managed/operator).
- To deploy W&B Self-Managed to a custom cloud platform that is not AWS, the requirements are similar to the requirements for deploying in [on-prem infrastructure](#deploy-wb-server-in-on-prem-infrastructure).
- To deploy W&B Self-Managed in air-gapped environments, see [Deploy on Air-Gapped Kubernetes](/platform/hosting/self-managed/on-premises-deployments/kubernetes-airgapped.mdx).

## Required infrastructure

Regardless of where W&B Self-Managed is deployed, the deployment depends on the following infrastructure:
- Kubernetes
- MySQL 8 database
- Amazon S3-compatible object storage
- Redis cache

See [Requirements](/platform/hosting/self-managed/requirements) for details. W&B can provide recommendations for the different components and provide guidance through the installation process.

## Obtain your W&B Server license

You need a W&B Server license before deploying. For step-by-step instructions, see [License](/platform/hosting/self-managed/requirements#license) on the Requirements page.
