W&B Dedicated Cloud applies rate limits to maintain instance stability. W&B can adjust limits when you scale up training or need higher throughput.

## Default limits and notification

<RateLimitsDefaultsAndNotification />

These defaults are recommended for typical production workloads. If your workloads consistently exceed these limits, contact [W&B support](mailto:support@wandb.com) or your Account Solutions Engineer (AISE) to request higher limits. Provide details of your experimental setup and usage patterns.
