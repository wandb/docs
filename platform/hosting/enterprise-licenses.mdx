description: Learn about W&B Enterprise licenses, what features they include, and how to obtain and configure them.
---

An Enterprise license unlocks advanced W&B features designed for organizations that need enhanced capabilities in areas of security, compliance, or administrative. See the list of [Enterprise features](#enterprise-features).

- **Security**: Enhanced authentication, encryption, and access controls.
- **Compliance**: Audit logging, HIPAA compliance options, and data governance controls.
- **Administration**: Advanced user management features like SCIM provisioning, custom roles, and automation capabilities.

This page provides a comprehensive overview of Enterprise licenses, including what features they enable, how to obtain them, and how to configure them for your deployment.

## Deployment Options
Enterprise licenses are available for W&B Dedicated Cloud and Self-Managed deployments.

- [W&B Dedicated Cloud](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/dedicated_cloud) provides single-tenant infrastructure managed by W&B, deployed in Google Cloud. Dedicated Cloud deployments automatically include an Enterprise license. No additional configuration is required, and all Enterprise features are available immediately upon provisioning.
- [W&B Self-Managed](/platform/hosting/hosting-options/self-managed) is deployed on your own infrastructure, providing full control over your deployment and data. Air-gapped deployments are supported. To access Enterprise features on W&B Self-Managed, you must obtain and configure an Enterprise license. Without an Enterprise license, Self-Managed deployments operate with limited features.

## Configure an Enterprise license
After you [obtain an Enterprise license](#obtain-an-enterprise-license) for W&B Self-Managed, you can configure it programmatically using your deployment tool, such as Helm or Terraform, or you can configure it in the W&B App after deployment. Select a tab to continue.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Helm">
1. Update your `values.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    wandb:
      license: "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"
    ```

2. Upgrade your Helm release:
    ```bash
    helm upgrade wandb wandb/wandb \
      --namespace wandb \
      --reuse-values \
      --set license=$LICENSE_KEY
    ```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform">
1. Update your Terraform variables:
    ```hcl
    variable "license" {
      default = "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"
    }
    ```

2. Apply the Terraform configuration:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -var="license=$LICENSE_KEY"
    ```
</Tab>
<Tab title="W&B App">

3. Find the **License** section
4. Enter your new license key
5. Save the changes
</Tab>
<Tab title="Docker">
<Warning>Deploying W&B on Docker is deprecated. W&B strongly encourages migrating to a [Kubernetes Operator]() deployment managed by Helm or Terraform. Refer to [Reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch.mdx) or contact [Support](mailto:support@wandb.ai) for guidance.</Warning>
Set the license key as an environment variable:
```bash
docker run -d \
  -e LICENSE="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE" \
  -e OTHER_ENV_VARS \
  wandb/local
```
