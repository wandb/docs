Serverless RL is supported through [OpenPipe's ART framework](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/about) and the [W&B Training API](/training/api-reference). 

To start using Serverless RL, satisfy the [prerequisites](/training/prerequisites) to use W&B tools, and then go through the ART [quickstart](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/quick-start).
- For code examples and workflows, see the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openpipe/art-notebooks/blob/main/examples/2048/2048.ipynb)).
- To learn about Serverless RL's API endpoints, see the [W&B Training API reference](/training/api-reference).
