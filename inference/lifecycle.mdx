  Learn about W&B Inference model lifecycle and retirement
---

New models are frequently evaluated and released as part of the W&B Inference catalog.

Older models are regularly reviewed and may be retired to prioritize the most in-demand and highest-quality offerings.

## Model Lifecycle Stages

Models in W&B Inference use the following terminology for the stages of their lifecycle:

* **Generally Available**: The model is fully supported and is recommended for use.
* **Deprecated**: The model is scheduled for removal. Customers should update to a recommended replacement as soon as possible.
* **Retired**: The model is no longer available. Any requests to retired models fail and return an `HTTP 404` status code for all requests.

## Deprecation Process

When deprecating a model, W&B will provide at least two weeks of notice on this page before the model is retired.

We additionally attempt to notify recent users of a deprecated model via email
and provide recommendations for replacement models.

Models that are in the **deprecated** stage continue to serve requests.
