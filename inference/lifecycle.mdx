New models are frequently evaluated and released as part of the W&B Inference catalog.

Older models are regularly reviewed, and may be retired to prioritize the most in demand and highest quality offerings.

## Terminology

Models in W&B Inference use the following terminology for the stages of their lifecycle.

* Generally Available: The model is fully supported and is recommended for use.
* Deprecated: The model is scheduled for removal. Customers should update to a recommended replacement as soon as possible.
* Retired: This model is no longer available. Any requests to retired models will fail.

## Deprecation Process

When deprecating a model, W&B will provide at least two weeks of notice on this page before the model is retired.

We will additionally attempt to notify recent users of a deprecated model via email
and provide recommendations for replacement models.

While the model is in the deprecated stage it will continue to serve requests.
Once the model is retired it will return an HTTP 404 status code for all requests.
