  Learn how to configure the Cline coding agent to use W&B Inference.

[Cline](https://cline.bot) is an AI-powered coding assistant. This tutorial demonstrates how to configure Cline to use models provided by W&B Inference.

The Cline agent is available as a command line tool or as an integration with many IDEs. This page will show configuration with the Cline CLI and with Cline as a Visual Studio Code extension; configuration in other IDEs should be similar.

## Prerequisites

You will need your [W&B API key](../prerequisites#set-up-your-wb-account-and-project).

## Cline CLI

Install the [Cline CLI](https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/installation) as needed.

```
npm install -g cline
```

See [Cline's installation instructions](https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/installation) for troubleshooting.

These instructions were tested with Cline CLI version `2.5.1`. You can run `cline version` to verify what you have installed.

Run the following command, substituting in your W&B API key.

```
cline auth -k <your_api_key> -p openai -b https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1 -m moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5
```

This will configure Cline to use W&B Inference's OpenAI-compatible endpoint and the Kimi K2.5 model. See [our model catalog](https://wandb.ai/inference) for model availability and pricing.

Run a simple test to verify everything is working:

```
cline "What is 2 + 2?"
```

If Cline responds with an answer, your installation and authentication are complete.

See the [Cline Quickstart](https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/installation#quick-start) for next steps.

## Cline in Visual Studio Code

Install Cline as a Visual Studio Code Extension. You can find it by searching the VS Code Extension marketplace or [clicking here](vscode:extension/saoudrizwan.claude-dev). Click the "Install" button.

Specify the following values, substituting in your W&B API key.

| Setting                        | Value                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| API Provider                   | OpenAI Compatible                   |
| Base URL                       | https://api.inference.wandb.ai/v1   |
| OpenAI Compatible API Key       | `<your_api_key>`                    |
| Model ID                       | moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5              |

Pricing can be specified by expanding Model Configuration, see [our model catalog](https://wandb.ai/inference) for costs and alternate model choices.

Click the Continue button.

Try submitting a prompt like "Write a Python program to compute the first 10 Fibonacci Numbers".
