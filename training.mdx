Now in public preview, W&B Training offers serverless reinforcement learning (RL) for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reliability performing multi-turn, agentic tasks while also increasing speed and reducing costs. RL is a training technique where models learn to improve their behavior through feedback on their outputs. 

W&B Training includes integration with:

* [ART](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/about), a flexible RL fine-tuning framework.
* [RULER](https://openpipe.ai/blog/ruler), a universal verifier. 
* A fully-managed backend on [CoreWeave Cloud](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/platform).

To get started, satisfy the [prerequisites](/training/prerequisites) to start using the service and then see [OpenPipe's Serverless RL quickstart](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/quick-start) to learn how to post-train your models.

Check out a [public demo workspace](https://wandb.ai/wandb/demo-project-qwen-email-agent-with-art-weave-models/workspace?nw=nwuserjuliarose) that includes the following examples:

* Train a Qwen model with OpenPipe RULER and [Weave Scorers](https://docs.wandb.ai/weave/guides/evaluation/scorers#create-your-own-scorers).
* Track training progress and [create custom plots](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/app/features/custom-charts) with W&B Models.
* Evaluate the final results on a [Weave leaderboard](https://docs.wandb.ai/weave/cookbooks/leaderboard_quickstart#leaderboard-quickstart)
