# Updated Fix Instructions

## Issue Found in PR #3

The preview comment showed that files weren't getting linked even with the temporary override. The problem was:

1. We were checking out the PR branch INSIDE the Hugo build step, but the checkout needs to happen at the workflow level
2. New files that aren't in `pageurls.json` need fallback URL construction logic

## New Fix Applied

I've created an updated patch that includes:

1. **Original fixes**:
   - Checkout PR branch before Hugo build
   - Fix include file path construction
   - Add special handling for index files
   - Prevent deleted files from having preview links

2. **Additional fixes**:
   - Move the PR branch checkout to the workflow level (in the checkout action)
   - Add fallback URL construction for new files not found in pageurls.json
   - Properly handle language-specific paths and _index.md files

## How to Apply the Updated Fix

1. In your fork (`mdlinville/docs`), apply the updated patch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard origin/main  # Reset to clean state
   git apply updated-testing-version-with-override.patch
   git add .
   git commit -m "Apply updated preview workflow fixes with temporary override"
   git push origin main --force
   ```

2. The PR #3 should automatically re-run the workflows with the updated fixes

3. Once the workflow completes, the preview comment should show:
   - ✅ Added files WITH links (e.g., `new-test-file.md` → `https://1607.docs-14y.pages.dev/guides/ai/new-test-file/`)
   - ✅ Modified files WITH links (e.g., `_index.md` → `https://1607.docs-14y.pages.dev/`)
   - ✅ Deleted files WITHOUT links

## What Changed

The key insight was that the workflow needs to checkout the PR branch at the very beginning, not during the Hugo build. Also, for truly new files that Hugo hasn't built yet, we need to construct the preview URLs manually based on the file paths.
