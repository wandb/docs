To find an API key, select the **Personal API key** or **Service Account API key** tab for details.

1. Log in to W&B, click your user profile icon, then click **User Settings**.
2. Scroll to the **API Keys** section.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Service account API key">
To find an API key owned by an organization or team service account:

The API keys table shows the key ID (the first part of each API key) for identification purposes. The full secret API key is only displayed once when you create it. If you need to use an existing key but do not have the full secret stored, you must create a new API key.
