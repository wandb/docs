To verify the installation, W&B recommends using the [W&B CLI](/models/ref/cli/). The verify command executes several tests that verify all components and configurations.

<Note>
This step assumes that the first admin user account is created with the browser.
</Note>

Follow these steps to verify the installation:

1. Install the W&B CLI:
```bash
pip install wandb
```

2. Log in to W&B:
```bash
wandb login --host=https://YOUR_DNS_DOMAIN
```

For example:
```bash
wandb login --host=https://wandb.company-name.com
```

3. Verify the installation:
```bash
wandb verify
```

A successful installation and fully working W&B deployment shows the following output:

```console
Default host selected:  https://wandb.company-name.com
