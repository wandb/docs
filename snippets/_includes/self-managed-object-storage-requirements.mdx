W&B requires object storage with pre-signed URL and CORS support.

For production deployments, W&B recommends using managed object storage services:
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage): Managed service for storing unstructured data at scale.
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/blobs): Cloud-based object storage solution for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.
- [CoreWeave AI Object Storage](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage): High-performance, S3-compatible object storage service optimized for AI workloads.

For self-hosted object storage options, see the [bare-metal guide object storage section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/bare-metal/#object-storage) for detailed setup instructions including CORS configuration and enterprise alternatives.

<Note>
MinIO Open Source is in [maintenance mode](https://github.com/minio/minio) with no active development or pre-compiled binaries. For production deployments, W&B recommends using managed object storage services or enterprise-grade S3-compatible solutions.

See the [reference architecture object storage section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#object-storage) for complete requirements.
