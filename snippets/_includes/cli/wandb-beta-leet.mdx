LEET is a local terminal UI for viewing a W&B run's stats, metrics, and system health. LEET is a keyboard-driven interface designed for users who work on remote systems or HPC environments using tools like SSH or `tmux`.

Key features include:
- **Keyboard-first navigation**: All features accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- **Live updates**: Monitors the `.wandb` file in real-time as your run progresses
- **Metric filtering**: Filter metrics using glob patterns or substring matching
- **Smart zooming**: Mouse wheel zoom keeps the latest data points in view
- **Customizable grids**: Configure the number of rows and columns for metric and system displays
- **Human-readable formatting**: System metrics show friendly units (e.g., "GPU Utilization (%)", "RAM Used (GB)")

LEET provides a three-panel layout:

- **Left sidebar**: Run Overview showing environment variables, configuration, and summary statistics
- **Center panel**: Metrics grid with Braille-style line charts for logged metrics
- **Right sidebar**: System Metrics displaying GPU utilization, RAM, CPU, and other system health indicators
