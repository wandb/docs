- **Self-Managed deployments**: See the [Operator configuration guide](/platform/hosting/self-managed/operator#object-storage-bucket) for Helm values configuration
- **Dedicated Cloud**: Configure via the [System Console](/platform/hosting/iam/sso#system-console)
- **Multi-tenant Cloud**: Configure when creating or editing a team
