W&B requires an external MySQL database. 

For production, W&B strongly recommends using managed database services:
- [AWS RDS Aurora MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)
- [Google Cloud SQL for MySQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/mysql)
- [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/mysql/)

Managed database services provide automated backups, monitoring, high availability, patching, and reduce operational overhead.

See the [reference architecture](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#mysql) for complete MySQL requirements, including sizing recommendations and configuration parameters. For database creation SQL, see the [bare-metal guide](/platform/hosting/self-managed/bare-metal/#mysql-database). For questions about your deployment's database configuration, contact [support](mailto:support@wandb.com) or your AISE.
