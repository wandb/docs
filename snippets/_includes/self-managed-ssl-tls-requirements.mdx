W&B requires a valid signed SSL/TLS certificate for secure communication between clients and the server. SSL/TLS termination must occur on the ingress/load balancer. The W&B Server application does not terminate SSL or TLS connections.

**Important**: W&B does not support self-signed certificates and custom CAs. Using self-signed certificates will cause challenges for users and is not supported.

If possible, using a service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) is a great way to provide trusted certificates to your load balancer. Services like Caddy and Cloudflare manage SSL for you.

If your security policies require SSL communication within your trusted networks, consider using a tool like Istio and [side car containers](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/sidecar/).
