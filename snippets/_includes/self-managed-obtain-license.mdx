You need a W&B license to deploy W&B Self-Managed.

1. If you do not already have a W&B account, create one.
2. If you need an enterprise trial license with support for important security and other enterprise-friendly capabilities, [submit a request](https://wandb.ai/site/for-enterprise/self-hosted-trial) or reach out to your W&B team.
3. Otherwise, open the [Deploy Manager](https://deploy.wandb.ai/deploy) to generate a free trial license. The URL redirects you to a **Get a License for W&B Local** form. Provide the following information:
   - The owner of the license
   - The deployment type
   - A name and optional description for the instance
4. Click **Generate License Key**.

A page displays with an overview of your deployment along with the license associated with the instance.
