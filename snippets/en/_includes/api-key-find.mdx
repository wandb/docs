To find your API key:

1. Navigate to [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings) and log in if necessary.
2. Alternatively, access your user settings:
   - Click your user profile icon in the upper-right corner.
   - Select **User Settings**.
   - Scroll to the **API Keys** section.

<Note>
The API keys table shows the key ID (the first part of each API key) for identification purposes. The full secret API key is only displayed once when you create it. If you need to use an existing key but do not have the full secret stored, you must create a new API key.
