Capture groups in your regular expression control how multi-metric panels are created. This behavior can be confusing if you're not expecting it.

- **Capture groups create multiple panels**
    When your regular expression includes parentheses that form a capture group, the UI creates a separate panel for each unique value captured by that group.

    For example, the expression `(layer_0|layer_10)_loss` includes a capture group and will create two separate panels:
    1. One panel for metrics matching `layer_0`.
    2. One panel for metrics matching `layer_10`.

- **Non-capturing groups keep metrics together**
    To match multiple alternatives without creating separate panels, use a non-capturing group with the `?:` syntax. The expression `(?:layer_0|layer_10)_loss` matches the same metrics as the previous example, but displays them together in a single panel.

Here's the difference:
- `(layer_0|layer_10)_loss` - Creates two panels, one for each layer
- `(?:layer_0|layer_10)_loss` - Creates one panel showing both layers together

This gives you flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your analysis needs. Use capture groups when you want to separate metrics into distinct panels. Use non-capturing groups when you want to compare metrics together on a single plot.
