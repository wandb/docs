Pin up to 5 runs to keep them easily accessible at the top of your workspace. Pinned runs remain visible regardless of sorting or filtering applied to other runs. Pinned runs appear at the top of the run selector with a circular pin icon, separated from other runs by a visual divider.

To pin a run:

1. Navigate to your workspace.
2. In the run selector or runs table, find the run you want to pin.
3. Click the action `...` menu, then select **Pin run**.
