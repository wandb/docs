Run your code in a docker container.

W&B docker lets you run your code in a docker image ensuring wandb is configured. It adds the WANDB_DOCKER and WANDB_API_KEY environment variables to your container and mounts the current directory in /app by default. You can pass additional args which will be added to `docker run` before the image name is declared, we'll choose a default image for you if one isn't passed:

```sh
wandb docker -v /mnt/dataset:/app/data
wandb docker gcr.io/kubeflow-images-public/tensorflow-1.12.0-notebook-cpu:v0.4.0 --jupyter
wandb docker wandb/deepo:keras-gpu --no-tty --cmd "python train.py --epochs=5"
```

By default, we override the entrypoint to check for the existence of wandb and install it if not present. If you pass the --jupyter flag we will ensure jupyter is installed and start jupyter lab on port 8888. If we detect nvidia-docker on your system we will use the nvidia runtime. If you just want wandb to set environment variable to an existing docker run command, see the wandb docker-run command.
