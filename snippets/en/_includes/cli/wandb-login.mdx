Verify and store your API key for authentication with W&B services.

By default, only store credentials locally without verifying them with W&B. To verify credentials, set `--verify=True`.

For server deployments (dedicated cloud or customer-managed instances), specify the host URL using the `--host` flag. You can also set environment variables `WANDB_BASE_URL` and `WANDB_API_KEY` instead of running the `login` command with host parameters.
