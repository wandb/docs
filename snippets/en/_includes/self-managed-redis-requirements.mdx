W&B depends on a single-node Redis 7.x deployment used by W&B's components for job queuing and data caching. For convenience during testing and development of proofs of concept, W&B Self-Managed includes a local Redis deployment that is not appropriate for production deployments.

For production deployments, W&B can connect to a Redis instance in the following environments:

- [AWS Elasticache](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/elasticache/)
- [Google Cloud Memory Store](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore?hl=en)
- [Azure Cache for Redis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cache)
- Redis deployment hosted in your cloud or on-premise infrastructure
