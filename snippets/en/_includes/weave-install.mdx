## Get your API key

Create a [Weights & Biases (W&B) account](https://wandb.ai) and [copy your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize). Your key allows you to authenticate with your W&B account.

Once you have secured your API key, you can either set it as an environment variable or enter it when prompted as your code runs. As a best practice, we recommend setting it as the environment variable `WANDB_API_KEY`. Weave automatically searches for this variable upon execution.
