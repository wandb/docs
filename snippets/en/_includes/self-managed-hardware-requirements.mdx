**CPU Architecture**: W&B runs on Intel (x86) CPU architecture only. ARM is not supported.

**Sizing**: For CPU, memory, and disk sizing recommendations for Kubernetes nodes and MySQL, see the [Sizing section](/platform/hosting/self-managed/ref-arch/#sizing) in the reference architecture. Requirements vary based on whether you're running Models, Weave, or both.
