The following default limits help maintain platform stability:

| Limit | Default | Scope |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Filestream requests per second | 500 | Project |
| Filestream size | 120 MB per second | Project |
| Filestream requests per run per second | 2 | Run |
| Run creation requests per second | 80 | Project |

When a limit is exceeded, the W&B SDK returns HTTP 429. You may see a message such as the following in your SDK logs:

```
HTTP 429: rate limit exceeded
```
