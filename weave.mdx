W&B Weave is an observability and evaluation platform that helps you track, evaluate, and improve your LLM application. With Weave, you can:

* [Observe and debug](/weave/quickstart) your LLM application
* [Evaluate](/weave/tutorial-eval) your application’s responses using LLM judges and custom scorers
