W&B Weave is an observability and evaluation platform that helps you track, evaluate, and improve your LLM application. With Weave, you can:

* [Observe and debug](/weave/quickstart) your LLM application
* [Evaluate](/weave/tutorial-eval) your application's responses using scorers and LLM judges

## Get Started

W&B Weave provides Python and TypeScript libraries.

To install the Weave library, run the following command:

First install the Weave library:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```bash
    pip install weave
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```bash
    pnpm install weave
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To start using the Weave library, create a [Weights & Biases (W&B) account](https://wandb.ai) and [obtain a copy your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize). The API key allows you to authenticate to your W&B account and start sending data to it.

## Next Steps
