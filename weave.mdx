W&B Weave is a powerful observability and evaluation platform that helps you track, evaluate, and improve your LLM application's performance. Weave has the ability to:

* [Trace](/weave/quickstart) your application's LLM calls, capturing inputs, outputs, costs, and latency
* [Evaluate](/weave/guides/core-types/evaluations) and [monitor](/weave/guides/evaluation/guardrails_and_monitors) your application's responses using scorers and LLM judges
* [Log versions](/weave/tutorial-weave_models) of your application's code, prompts, datasets, and other attributes
* [Create leaderboards](/weave/guides/core-types/leaderboards) to track and compare your application's performance over time
* [Integrate Weave into your W&B reinforcement-learning training runs](/weave/guides/tools/weave-in-workspaces) to gain observability into how your models perform during training

Weave works with many [popular frameworks](/weave/guides/integrations) and has both [Python](/weave/reference/python-sdk) and [TypeScript SDKs](/weave/reference/typescript-sdk).

## Get Started

See the following quickstart docs to install and learn how integrate Weave into your code:

* [Track LLM inputs and outputs](/weave/quickstart)
* [Learn Weave with W&B inference](/weave/quickstart-inference)

You can also review the following Python example to get a quick understanding of how Weave is implemented into code:

<Accordion title="Send requests to OpenAI and evaluate their responses" >

The following example sends simple math questions to OpenAI and then evaluates the responses for correctness (in parallel) using the built-in `CorrectnessScorer()`:

```python lines
import weave
from openai import OpenAI
from weave import Scorer
import asyncio

# Initialize Weave
weave.init("parallel-evaluation")

# Create OpenAI client
client = OpenAI()

# Define your model as a weave.op function
@weave.op
def math_model(question: str) -> str:
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": question}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Create a dataset with questions and expected answers
dataset = [
    {"question": "What is 2+2?", "expected": "4"},
    {"question": "What is 5+3?", "expected": "8"},
    {"question": "What is 10-7?", "expected": "3"},
    {"question": "What is 12*3?", "expected": "36"},
    {"question": "What is 100/4?", "expected": "25"},
]

# Define a class-based scorer
class CorrectnessScorer(Scorer):
    """Scorer that checks if the answer is correct"""
    
    @weave.op
    def score(self, question: str, expected: str, output: str) -> dict:
        """Check if the model output contains the expected answer"""
        import re
        
        # Extract numbers from the output
        numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', output)
        
        if numbers:
            answer = numbers[0]
            correct = answer == expected
        else:
            correct = False
        
        return {
            "correct": correct,
            "extracted_answer": numbers[0] if numbers else None,
            "contains_expected": expected in output
        }

# Instantiate the scorer
correctness_scorer = CorrectnessScorer()

# Create an evaluation
evaluation = weave.Evaluation(
    dataset=dataset,
    scorers=[correctness_scorer]
)

# Run the evaluation - automatically evaluates examples in parallel
asyncio.run(evaluation.evaluate(math_model))
```

To use this example, follow the [installation instructions](/weave/quickstart#1-install-w%26b-weave-and-create-an-api-key) in the first step of the quickstart. You also need an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
