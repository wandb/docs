# Agent prompt: Testing GitHub Actions changes in wandb/docs

## Agent prerequisites
Before starting, gather this information from the user:
1. **GitHub username** - Needed to identify their fork
2. **Fork status** - Confirm they have a fork of wandb/docs that can be used for testing
3. **Test scope** - What specific changes are being tested (dependency upgrade, functionality change, etc.)

## Task overview
Test changes to GitHub Actions workflows in the wandb/docs repository, particularly the PR preview link generation workflows that depend on Cloudflare Pages deployments.

> **Note**: If you are testing changes to an action that doesn't depend on Cloudflare, adjust your interpretation of this runbook accordingly.

## Context and constraints

### Repository setup
- **Main repository**: `wandb/docs` (origin)
- **Fork for testing**: `<username>/docs` (fork remote) - Agent should ask user for their fork username
- **Important**: GitHub Actions in PRs always run from the base branch (main), not from the PR branch
- **Cloudflare limitation**: Cloudflare Pages only builds for the main wandb/docs repository, not for forks

**Agent note**: You'll need to:
1. Ask the user for their GitHub username to identify their fork
2. Verify they have a fork of wandb/docs that can be used for testing
3. If you can't push to the fork directly, create a temporary branch in wandb/docs for the user to push from

### Key workflows
1. `.github/workflows/pr-preview-links.yml` - Runs on PR open/sync
2. `.github/workflows/pr-preview-links-on-comment.yml` - Triggered by Cloudflare comments

### Testing requirements
To test workflow changes, you must:
1. Sync the fork's `main` with the main repo's `main`, throwing away all temporary commits.
2. Apply changes to the fork's main branch (not just a feature branch)
2. Override Cloudflare URLs since they won't generate for forks
3. Create a test PR with content changes to trigger the workflows

## Step-by-step testing process

### 1. Initial setup
```bash
# First, ask the user for their GitHub username
# Example: "What is your GitHub username for the fork we'll use for testing?"

# Ensure you have both remotes configured
git remote -v  # Should show 'origin' (wandb/docs) and 'fork' (<username>/docs)

# If fork remote is missing:
git remote add fork https://github.com/<username>/docs.git  # Replace <username> with actual username
```

### 2. Prepare test branch
```bash
# Start from latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create test branch for the workflow changes
git checkout -b test-[description]-[date]
```

### 3. Apply workflow changes
Make your changes to the workflow files. For dependency upgrades:
- Update version numbers in `uses:` statements
- Check both workflow files if the dependency is used in multiple places

### 4. Add Cloudflare URL override
Since Cloudflare won't build for forks, add this override to BOTH workflow files:

For `pr-preview-links.yml`, after the URL extraction logic (around line ~220):
```javascript
// TEMPORARY OVERRIDE FOR FORK TESTING
// Since Cloudflare won't run on forks, use a hardcoded URL
if (!base && context.repo.owner === '<username>') {  // Replace <username> with actual fork owner
  base = 'https://main.docodile.pages.dev';
  core.warning('Using temporary override URL for fork testing: ' + base);
}
```

**Pro tip**: Before finalizing any runbook, ask an AI agent to review it with a prompt like:
> "Please review this runbook and suggest improvements to make it more useful for AI agents. Focus on clarity, completeness, and removing ambiguity."

For `pr-preview-links-on-comment.yml`, after the URL extraction (around line ~126):
```javascript
// TEMPORARY OVERRIDE FOR FORK TESTING
// Since Cloudflare won't run on forks, use a hardcoded URL
if (!branchUrl && context.repo.owner === '<username>') {  // Replace <username> with actual fork owner
  branchUrl = 'https://main.docodile.pages.dev';
  core.warning('Using temporary override URL for fork testing: ' + branchUrl);
}
```

### 5. Commit and push to fork's main
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "test: [Description of what you're testing]

- Add Cloudflare URL override for fork testing
- [Other changes made]"

# Push to fork's main branch
git push fork HEAD:main --force-with-lease
```

**Agent instructions for fork access**:
If you can't push to the fork directly:
1. Create a temporary branch in wandb/docs with the changes
2. Provide the user with this command:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin temp-branch-name
   git push fork origin/temp-branch-name:main --force
   ```
3. Guide them to create the PR at: `https://github.com/<username>/docs/compare/main...test-pr-[description]`
4. Remember to delete the temporary branch from wandb/docs after testing


### 6. Create test PR
```bash
# Create new branch from the updated fork main
git checkout -b test-pr-[description]

# Make a small content change to trigger workflows
echo "<!-- Test change for PR preview -->" >> content/en/guides/quickstart.md

# Commit and push
git add content/en/guides/quickstart.md
git commit -m "test: Add content change to trigger PR preview"
git push fork test-pr-[description]
```

Then create PR via GitHub UI from `<username>:test-pr-[description]` to `<username>:main`

### 7. Monitor and verify

Expected behavior:
1. GitHub Actions bot creates initial comment with "Generating preview links..."
2. Workflow should complete without errors
3. Comment should update with preview links pointing to `https://main.docodile.pages.dev/...`

Check for:
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully
- ✅ Preview comment is created and updated
- ✅ Links use the override URL
- ✅ File categorization works (Added/Modified/Deleted/Renamed)
- ❌ Any errors in the Actions logs
- ❌ Security warnings or exposed secrets

### 8. Cleanup
After testing:
```bash
# Reset fork's main to match upstream
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git push fork main --force

# Delete test branches from fork and origin
git branch -D test-[description]-[date] test-pr-[description]
```

## Common issues and solutions

### Issue: Permission denied when pushing to fork
- The GitHub token might be read-only
- Solution: Use SSH or push manually from your local machine

### Issue: Workflows not triggering
- Remember: Workflows run from the base branch (main), not the PR branch
- Ensure changes are in fork's main branch

### Issue: Preview links not generating
- Check if Cloudflare override is properly added
- Verify the override URL is correct: `https://main.docodile.pages.dev`

### Issue: Changed files not detected
- Ensure content changes are in tracked directories (content/, static/, assets/, etc.)
- Check the `files:` filter in the workflow configuration

## Testing checklist

- [ ] Asked user for their GitHub username and fork details
- [ ] Both remotes (origin and fork) are configured
- [ ] Workflow changes applied to both relevant files
- [ ] Cloudflare URL override added with correct username in owner check
- [ ] Changes pushed to fork's main branch (directly or via user)
- [ ] Test PR created with content changes
- [ ] Preview comment generated successfully
- [ ] No errors in GitHub Actions logs
- [ ] Fork's main branch reset after testing
- [ ] Temporary branches cleaned up from wandb/docs (if created)

## Notes
- The Cloudflare preview domain is `docodile.pages.dev`
- Branch previews normally use pattern: `https://[branch-name].docodile.pages.dev`
- The override uses the main branch preview as a stable fallback
- Always remember to remove the Cloudflare override before merging to production
