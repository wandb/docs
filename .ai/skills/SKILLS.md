## Overview

This guide provides code blocks that demonstrate canonical and best-practice usage of Weights & Biases (W&B) for tracking machine learning experiments.

Each code block is a self-contained example that illustrates how to perform specific tasks using the W&B Python SDK. The examples cover a range of functionalities, including initializing runs, logging metrics, managing artifacts, and more.

Strings with angle brackets (e.g., `<project>`, `<entity>`, `<artifact>`, `<alias>`, `<description>`) are placeholders that should be replaced with actual values relevant to your W&B setup.
