# ✅ Data Type Properties Fixed

## Problems Identified

### 1. Missing Properties
**Artifact.md** only showed 4 properties (id, name, type, versions) but the example showed 11 fields!

### 2. Wrong Order
Properties were listed in a different order than shown in the example, making it confusing to understand the structure.

## What Was Fixed

### Complete Property Documentation
All data types now document ALL fields shown in their examples:

#### Before (Artifact.md):
- Only documented: id, name, type, versions
- Missing: project, entity, state, description, metadata, createdAt, updatedAt

#### After (Artifact.md):
Now documents all 10 fields from the example:
```
1. id
2. name
3. type
4. project
5. entity
6. state
7. description (Optional)
8. metadata (Optional)
9. createdAt
10. updatedAt
```

### Properties Match Example Order

**Before:** Random order
```typescript
// Example showed:
{ id, name, project, entity, config, summary, ... }

// But properties were listed as:
config, createdAt, entity, heartbeatAt, ...
```

**After:** Same order as example
```typescript
// Example shows:
{ id, name, project, entity, config, summary, ... }

// Properties now listed in same order:
id, name, project, entity, config, summary, ...
```

## Files Updated

✅ **Artifact.md** - 10 properties (was 4)
✅ **Run.md** - 10 properties in correct order
✅ **ArtifactVersion.md** - 7 properties in correct order
✅ **User.md** - 3 properties in correct order
✅ **Entity.md** - 3 properties in correct order
✅ **Project.md** - 4 properties in correct order
✅ **ArtifactType.md** - 3 properties in correct order

### Kept As-Is
- **ConfigDict.md** - Dynamic dictionary, properties vary
- **SummaryDict.md** - Variable metrics plus fixed fields
- **Table.md** - Variable structure

## Additional Cleanup

Removed generic "See Also" sections from all 10 data type files (not relevant for type definitions).

## Benefits

✅ **Complete documentation** - All fields are now documented
✅ **Logical flow** - Properties match the example order
✅ **Less confusion** - Structure is immediately clear from the example
✅ **Better learning** - Users can map example to properties easily

## Note for Future

⚠️ **TypeDoc Limitation**: TypeDoc may generate properties in alphabetical order or based on source code order. The postprocess-hugo.js script should be enhanced to:
1. Parse the example code block
2. Extract field order from the example
3. Reorder properties to match

This would ensure consistency is maintained even after regeneration.
