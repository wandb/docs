# ✅ Simplified Operations Structure

## What Was Removed

### "Chainable Operations Functions" Header
**Problem:** 
- Confusing terminology - "Chainable" was never explained
- Added unnecessary nesting level
- No real value to readers

**Solution:**
- Removed this intermediate header entirely
- Operations now start directly after the description

## New, Cleaner Structure

### Before (3 levels deep):
```markdown
---
title: Artifact Operations
---

Operations for querying and manipulating W&B artifacts

## Chainable Operations Functions   ← Removed!

### artifactLink                    ← Was H3

#### Parameters                     ← Was H4
```

### After (Clean TOC):
```markdown
---
title: Artifact Operations
---

Operations for querying and manipulating W&B artifacts

## artifactLink                     ← Now H2 (appears in TOC)

#### Parameters                     ← Stays H4 (hidden from TOC)
```

## Benefits

✅ **Simpler hierarchy** - One less level of nesting
✅ **Clearer structure** - Operations are the main content, so they're H2
✅ **No confusing terms** - Removed unexplained "Chainable" concept
✅ **Better TOC** - Table of contents shows operations directly

## What Changed

1. **Removed** "Chainable Operations Functions" header
2. **Promoted** operations from H3 → H2
3. **Kept** subsections (Parameters, Examples, See Also) at H4 level

## Post-Processor Updates

The `postprocess-hugo.js` script now:
- Automatically removes "Chainable Operations Functions" header
- Bumps operations to H2 level
- Keeps subsections at H4 (hidden from TOC)
- Handles different heading levels for operations vs data types

## Results

- **2 operations files** restructured
- **19 operations** promoted to H2
- **73 subsections** kept at H4 (won't clutter TOC)
- Documentation is now cleaner and more intuitive

The operations reference now has a straightforward, logical structure!
