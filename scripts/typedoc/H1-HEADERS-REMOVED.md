# ✅ H1 Headers Removed - Title in Front Matter Only

## Issue Resolved
TypeDoc was generating H1 headers like `# Module: Artifact Operations` even though the title was already in Hugo's front matter, creating redundancy.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed from Existing Files
✅ All H1 headers removed from:
- 2 operations files
- 10 data type files

### 2. Post-Processor Updated
The `postprocess-hugo.js` now removes H1 headers automatically:
```javascript
// Remove H1 headers - title is already in front matter
// Matches lines like "# Interface: ConfigDict" or "# Module: Artifact Operations"
content = content.replace(/^#\s+.+\n\n?/gm, '');
```

Key improvements:
- Uses `gm` flags (global + multiline) to catch all H1s
- Handles both `# Interface:` and `# Module:` patterns
- Removes the header and any following blank line

## Result

### Before
```markdown
---
title: Artifact Operations
---

# Module: Artifact Operations

**`Description`**

Operations for querying...
```

### After
```markdown
---
title: Artifact Operations
---

**`Description`**

Operations for querying...
```

## Hugo Best Practice

This follows Hugo best practices:
- **Title in front matter** - Hugo uses this for page titles and navigation
- **No H1 in content** - Avoids duplicate titles in rendered output
- **Start with content** - Documentation begins immediately with description

## Future Generations

When running:
```bash
./scripts/typedoc/generate-docs.sh /path/to/wandb/core
```

The post-processor will:
1. Keep title in front matter
2. Remove any H1 headers from content
3. Ensure clean, non-redundant output

## Verification

All files checked and confirmed:
- ✅ operations/Artifact_Operations.md - No H1
- ✅ operations/Run_Operations.md - No H1  
- ✅ All 10 data type files - No H1s

The documentation now properly uses Hugo's front matter for titles without redundant H1 headers in the content!
