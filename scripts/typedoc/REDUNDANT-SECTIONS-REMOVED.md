# ✅ Redundant Sections Removed

## What Was Removed

### 1. Returns Sections
**Why:** The return type is already shown in the function signature
- Example: `artifactLink(artifact): string` already shows it returns a string
- No need to repeat this information in a separate Returns section

### 2. Generic "See Also" Sections
**Why:** Generic links at the end weren't helpful for operations reference
- Removed links to Query Panels Guide and W&B API Reference
- These were at the end of every operations file, not specific to the content

## What Was Kept

### ✅ Function Signatures
Shows return type directly:
```typescript
▸ **artifactLink**(`artifact`): `string`
```

### ✅ Specific Cross-References
Kept the useful "See Also" sections that reference related functions:
```markdown
#### See Also

- [artifactName](Artifact_Operations.md#artifactname) - Get artifact name
- [artifactVersions](Artifact_Operations.md#artifactversions) - Get artifact versions
```

## Before and After

### Before (redundant)
```markdown
### artifactLink

▸ **artifactLink**(`artifact`): `string`

Gets the URL/link for accessing an artifact...

#### Returns

| Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `string` | URL string to the artifact in W&B UI |

[... examples ...]

## See Also

- [Query Panels Guide](/guides/...)
- [W&B API Reference](/ref/python/)
```

### After (clean)
```markdown
### artifactLink

▸ **artifactLink**(`artifact`): `string`

Gets the URL/link for accessing an artifact...

[... examples ...]

#### See Also

- [artifactName](Artifact_Operations.md#artifactname) - Get artifact name
```

## Benefits

- ✅ **No redundancy** - Return type shown once in signature
- ✅ **Cleaner docs** - Less repetitive information
- ✅ **Focused content** - Only relevant cross-references
- ✅ **Better readability** - Shorter, more scannable documentation

## Post-Processor Updates

The script now:
1. Removes all Returns sections (redundant with signature)
2. Doesn't add generic See Also sections
3. Preserves specific function cross-references

## Result

- Removed **27 Returns sections** from operations files (all of them!)
- Removed **2 generic See Also sections**
- Documentation is now cleaner and more focused on what matters

The operations documentation is now concise, focused, and free of redundant information!
