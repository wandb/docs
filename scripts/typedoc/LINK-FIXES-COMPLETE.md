# ✅ Link Issues Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Data Type Links
**Problem:** Links were pointing to wrong paths
```markdown
❌ OLD: [`Artifact`](../interfaces/W_B_Query_Expression_Language.Artifact.md)
✅ NEW: [`Artifact`](../data-types/Artifact.md)
```

**Why it matters:**
- Interfaces directory doesn't exist (we moved to data-types)
- Removed unnecessary prefix from filenames
- Links now actually work!

### 2. Same-Page Anchor Links
**Problem:** Links included filename unnecessarily
```markdown
❌ OLD: [artifactName](Artifact_Operations.md#artifactname)
✅ NEW: [artifactName](#artifactname)
```

**Why it matters:**
- More portable (works if file is renamed)
- Cleaner and simpler
- Standard markdown practice

## Results

### Operations Files Fixed
- **Artifact_Operations.md**: 11 data type links + 10 anchor links
- **Run_Operations.md**: 26 data type links + 14 anchor links

### Examples of Fixed Links

#### Data Type Parameters
```markdown
| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |

| `run` | [`Run`](../data-types/Run.md) | The W&B run object |
```

#### See Also Sections
```markdown
#### See Also

- [artifactName](#artifactname) - Get artifact name
- [artifactVersions](#artifactversions) - Get artifact versions
- [runSummary](#runsummary) - For accessing summary metrics
```

## Post-Processor Updates

The `postprocess-hugo.js` script now automatically:

1. **Fixes data type references**
   - Converts `../interfaces/` paths to `../data-types/`
   - Removes `W_B_Query_Expression_Language.` prefix

2. **Fixes anchor links**
   - Removes filename from same-page anchors
   - Keeps only the `#anchor` part

## Benefits

✅ **Working links** - All internal references now resolve correctly
✅ **Portable** - Links work even if files are renamed
✅ **Clean** - No unnecessary prefixes or redundant filenames
✅ **Future-proof** - Will be applied to all future generations

The documentation now has proper, working navigation between all related content!
