To remove projects from a team space without admin privileges, you have two options:

- Request that a current admin remove the projects for you.
- Ask the admin to grant you the necessary access to manage the projects temporarily. 

If you can't reach the admin, contact a billing admin or another authorized user in your organization who can assist.
