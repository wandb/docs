You can move a run from one project to another by following these steps:

- Navigate to the project page with the run to be moved.
- Click on the **Runs** tab to open the runs table.
- Select the run(s) to move.
- Click the **Move** button.
- Choose the destination project and confirm the action.

W&B supports moving runs through the UI, but does not support copying runs. Artifacts logged with the runs do not transfer to the new project.
