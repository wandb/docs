1. **How can I change the colors of each run in the same group?**
   - Currently, changing the colors of individual runs within a group is not possible. All runs in the same group share a common color.

2. **Is there any way to group runs without using the "Group" feature?**
   - Yes, you can use tags or custom metadata to categorize runs. That can be done using the `Group` button which is available in the Workspace and Runs views of the project.
