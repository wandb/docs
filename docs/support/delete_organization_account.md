To delete your organization account, follow these steps:

1. **Contact Support**: Reach out to the support team of your service provider. This step is necessary as organization account deletions usually require administrative intervention.
2. **Provide Details**: When contacting support, include your organization name and any relevant account details to expedite the process.
3. **Confirm Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary administrative permissions or are the account owner to request deletion.

For precise instructions, refer to your platform's help documentation or customer support.
