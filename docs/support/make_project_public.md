To make your project public in Weights & Biases, follow these steps:

1. Go to your project page on the Weights & Biases web app.
2. Click on the lock icon in the navigation bar to open privacy settings.
3. Select "Public" if available to make your project visible to anyone.
4. Save your changes.

If "Public" isn't available due to restrictions, you might need to:

- Share a view-only link via a report.
- Contact your organization's admin for assistance.
- Ensure your account settings allow for public projects.
