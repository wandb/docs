W&B currently supports run alert notifications via email and Slack, but not directly to Microsoft Teams. However, you can still receive W&B alerts in Teams by following these steps:

- **Set up an email address for your Microsoft Teams channel.** In Microsoft Teams, create an email address for the channel where you want to receive alerts.
- **Forward W&B alert emails to the Teams channel's email address.** Configure W&B to send alerts via email, and forward these alert emails to your Teams channel's email.

This workaround enables you to receive W&B alerts in Microsoft Teams indirectly.
