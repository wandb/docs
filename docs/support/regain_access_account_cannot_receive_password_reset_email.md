To regain access to your account if you cannot receive a password reset email:

1. **Check Spam or Junk Folders:** Ensure the email isn't filtered there.
2. **Verify Email**: Confirm you are using the correct email associated with the account.
3. **Check for SSO Options:** Try services like "Sign in with Google" if applicable.
4. **Reach Out to Support:** If issues persist, provide your username and email and contact support for assistance.
