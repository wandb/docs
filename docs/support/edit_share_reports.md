Reports that are created within an individual's private project is only visible to that user. The user can share their project to a team or to the public.

On team projects, both the administrator, or member who created the report, can toggle permissions between edit or view access for other team members. Team members can share reports.

To share a report, select the **Share** button on the upper right hand corner.  You can either provide an email account or copy the magic link. Users invited by email will need to log into W&B to view the report. Users who are given a magic link to not need to log into W&B to view the report.

Shared reports are view-only.
