The W&B client library supported both Python 2.7 and Python 3 through version 0.10. Due to the Python 2 end of life, support for Python 2.7 was discontinued as of version 0.11. Users who run`pip install --upgrade wandb` on a Python 2.7 system will get new releases of the 0.10.x series only. Support for the 0.10.x series will be limited to critical bugfixes and patches. Currently, version 0.10.33 is the last version of the 0.10.x series that supports Python 2.7.
