Key engineers and support staff at W&B can access the logged values for cases of debugging with your permission. All data is stored encrypted at rest and audit logs are kept to record any access. If you require the data to be completely inaccessible to any W&B employees you can license our self-hosted solution and run a W&B server within your own infrastructure.
