Yes, you can move a run from one project to another in W&B. To do this, follow these steps:

- Go to the project page containing the run you want to move.
- Click on the "Runs" tab to expand the runs table.
- Select the run(s) you want to move.
- Click the "Move" button.
- Choose the destination project and confirm the move.

Moving runs is possible via the W&B UI, but copying runs is not supported.
Artifacts logged with the Runs won't be moved to the new project.
