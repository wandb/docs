To recover deleted runs, follow these steps:

- Go to the Project Overview page.
- Click on the three dots in the top right corner.
- Select "Undelete recently deleted runs."

Note:
- You can only restore runs deleted within the last 7 days.
- If you've logged data on a server, consider manually uploading logs using the wandb API if undelete isn't applicable.
- For further assistance, contact support.
