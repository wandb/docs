<!-- For a live example of a Project's Workspace, [see this example project](https://app.wandb.ai/example-team/sweep-demo).  -->

View a information about a specific run such as the state of the run, artifacts logged to the run, log files recorded during the run, and more. 

To view a specific run:

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home).
2. Navigate to the W&B project you specified when you initialized the run.
3. Within the project sidebar, select the **Workspace** tab.
4. Within the run selector, select the run you want to view.

Note that the URL path of a specific run has the proceeding format:

```text
https://wandb.ai/<team-name>/<project-name>/runs/<run-id>
```

Where values enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) are placeholders for the actual values of the team name, project name, and run ID.

## Overview tab
Use the **Overview** tab learn about a specific run in a project, such as:


* **Name**: The name of the run.
* **Description**: A description of the run that you provided. This field is left initially blank if you do not specify a description when you create the run. You can add a description to a run with the W&B App UI or programmatically with the Python SDK.
* **Tags**: A list of strings. Tags are useful for organizing runs together, or applying temporary labels like "baseline" or "production".
* **Author**: The W&B entity that creates the run.
* **State**: The [state of the run](#run-states).
* **Start time**: The timestamp when the run is initialized.
* **Duration**: The amount of time the run is actively computing or logging data. Excludes any pauses or time waiting.
* **Run path**:  The unique run identifier. It has the form of `entity/project/run-ID`.
* **Host name**: Where the run is computed. The name of your machine is displayed if you initialized the run locally on your machine. 
* **OS**: Operating system that initialized the run.
* **Python version**: The Python version used to create the run.
* **Python executable**: The command that starts the run.
* **Git repository**: [If git is enabled](../app/settings-page/user-settings.md#personal-github-integration), the git repository associated with the run.
* **Git state**:
* **Command**: The command that initialized the run.
* **System hardware**: The hardware the run was executed on.
* **W&B CLI version**: The W&B ClI version installed on the machine that hosted the run command.



Below the overview section, you will additionally find information about: 

* **Artifact Outputs**: Artifact outputs produced by the run.
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.config`](../../guides/track/config.md).
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.log()`](../../guides/track/log/intro.md). By default, this value is set to the last value logged.

### Run states
The proceeding table describes the possible states a run can be in: 

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Finished| Run ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.finish()` |
| Failed | Run ended with a non-zero exit status | 
| Crashed | Run stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes | 
| Running | Run is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat  |

## Workspace tab
Use the Workspace tab to view, search, group and arrange visualizations such as autogenerated and custom plots, system metrics, and more.

## System tab
The **System tab** shows system metrics tracked for a specific run such as CPU utilization, system memory, disk I/O, network traffic, GPU utilization and more.

For a full list of system metrics W&B tracks, see [System metrics](../app/features/system-metrics.md).

## Logs tab
The **Log tab** shows output printed on the command line such as the stdout and stderr. W&B shows the last 10,000 lines. 

Click the **Download** button in the upper right hand corner to download the log file.
