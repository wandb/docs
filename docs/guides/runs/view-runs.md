<!-- For a live example of a Project's Workspace, [see this example project](https://app.wandb.ai/example-team/sweep-demo).  -->

View a information about a specific run such as the state of the run, artifacts logged to the run, log files recorded during the run, and more. To view a specific run:

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home).
2. Navigate to the W&B project you specified when you initialized the run.
3. Within your project's workspace, you will see a table labeled **Runs**. This table lists all the runs that are in your project. From the list of runs shown, select the run you want to view.

<!-- The following image demonstrates information about a run called **sparkling-glade-2**:

<!-- NEW  -->
The proceeding sections describe the different tabs available:

## Overview tab
Use the **Overview** tab learn about a specific run in a project, such as:


* **Name**: The name of the run
* **Description**: A description of the run that you provided. This field is left initially blank if you do not specify a description when you create the run. You can optionally provide a description for the run with the W&B App UI or programmatically.
* **Tags**: (list, optional) A list of strings. Tags are useful for organizing runs together, or applying temporary labels like "baseline" or "production".
* **Author**: The W&B entity that creates the run
* **State**: The [state of the run](#run-states)
* **Start time**: The timestamp when the run is initialized
* **Duration**: The amount of time the run is actively computing or logging data. Excludes any pauses or time waiting.
* **Run path**:  The unique run identifier. It has the form of `entity/project/run-ID`
* **Host name**: Where the run was launched. The name of your machine is displayed if you launched the run locally on your machine. 
* **OS**: Operating system that initialized the run
* **Python version**: The Python version used to create the run
* **Python executable**: The command that started the run.
* **Git repository**: [If git is enabled](../app/settings-page/user-settings.md#personal-github-integration), the git repository associated with the run
* **Git state**:
* **Command**: The command that initialized the run
* **System hardware**: The hardware the run was executed on
* **W&B CLI version**: The W&B ClI version installed on the machine that hosted the run command.



Below the overview section, you will additionally find information about: 

* **Artifact Outputs**: Artifact outputs produced by the run.
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.config`](../../guides/track/config.md).
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.log()`](../../guides/track/log/intro.md). By default, this value is set to the last value logged.

### Run states
The proceeding table describes the possible states a run can be in: 

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Finished| Run ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.finish()` |
| Failed | Run ended with a non-zero exit status | 
| Crashed | Run stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes | 
| Running | Run is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat  |

## Workspace tab
Use the Workspace tab to view, search, group and arrange visualizations such as:

* Autogenerated plots such as examples predictions made by a validation set
* Custom plots
* System metrics and more

## System tab
The **System tab** shows system metrics tracked for a specific run such as: Visualize CPU utilization, System memory, Disk I/O, Network traffic, GPU utilization and more. For a full list of system metrics W&B tracks, see [System metrics](../app/features/system-metrics.md).

## Model tab

See the layers of your model, the number of parameters, and the output shape of each layer within the **Model Tab**.

## Logs tab
The **Log tab** shows output printed on the command line such as the stdout and stderr. W&B shows the last 10,000 lines. 

Click the **Download** button in the upper right hand corner to download the log file.
