## Stop a run 


## Delete unwanted runs

1. Navigate to the project that contains the runs you want to delete.
2. Select the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Select the checkbox next to the runs you want to delete.
4. Choose the **Delete** button (trash can icon) above the table.

For projects that contain a large number of runs, you can use either the search bar to filter runs you want to delete using Regex or the filter button to filter runs based on their status, tags, or other properties. Once you have filtered down the runs to the ones you want to delete, you can select all and select the **Delete** to remove the runs from your project.
