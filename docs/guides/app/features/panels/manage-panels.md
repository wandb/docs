# Manage and organize your panels


## Activate or deactivate auto generated panels

By default, W&B generates a panel for each unique metric you [log](../../../../ref/python/log.md) with the Python SDK. To turn on or off this functionality: 


1. Navigate to your project's workspace
2. Select on the gear icon in the upper right hand corner
3. A modal appears, choose **Sections**
4. Toggle the **Panel generation** option on or off
![](/images/app_ui/panel_generation.png)

Each workspace indicates whether or not the workspace automatically generates panels. Next to the name of your workspace you will see a clipboard icon. If the icon is red, panels are not automatically generated. If the the panel is green, panels are automatically created each time you log a unique metric.

Example of workspace with panel auto generation off:
![](/images/app_ui/auto_panel_off.png)

Example of workspace with panel auto generation on:
![](/images/app_ui/auto_panel_on.png)

## Clear existing panels

Clear panels from an existing workspace:

1. Navigate to your project's workspace
2. Select the three horizontal dots (**...**) next to the panel search bar
3. Select **Clear all panels**

Clearing panels in your workspace deactivates automatic panel generation.
