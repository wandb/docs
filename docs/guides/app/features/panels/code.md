By default, W&B only saves the latest git commit hash. You can turn on more code features to compare the code between your experiments dynamically in the UI.

Starting with `wandb` version 0.8.28, W&B can save the code from your main training file where you call `wandb.init()`. 



## Save library code

When code saving is enabled, W&B will save the code from the file that called `wandb.init()`. To save additional library code, you have two options:

* Call `wandb.run.log_code(".")` after calling `wandb.init()`
```python
import wandb

wandb.init()
wandb.run.log_code(".")
```

* Pass a settings object to `wandb.init` with `code_dir` set:
```python
import wandb
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(code_dir="."))
```

This will capture all python source code files in the current directory and all subdirectories as an [artifact](../../../../ref/python/artifact.md). For more control over the types and locations of source code files that are saved, see the [reference docs](../../../../ref/python/run.md#log_code).

## Code comparer
Compare code used in different W&B runs:

1. Select the **Add panels** button in the top right corner of the page.
2. Expand **TEXT AND CODE** dropdown and select **Code**.

## Jupyter session history

W&B saves the history of code executed in your Jupyter notebook session. When you call **wandb.init()** inside of Jupyter, W&B adds a hook to automatically save a Jupyter notebook containing the history of code executed in your current session. 


1. Navigate to your project workspaces that contains your code.
2. Select the **Artifacts** tab in the left navigation bar.
3. Expand the **code** artifact.
4. Select the **Files** tab.

This displays the cells that were run in your session along with any outputs created by calling iPythonâ€™s display method. This enables you to see exactly what code was run within Jupyter in a given run. When possible W&B also saves the most recent version of the notebook which you would find in the code directory as well.
