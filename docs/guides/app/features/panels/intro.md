Use workspace panel visualizations to explore your logged data, the relationships between hyperparameters and output metrics, and more. 

## Workspace modes

Weights and Biases projects support two different workspace modes: 

- **Automated workspaces** (default) automatically generate panels for all keys logged in the project. This can help you get started by visualizing all available data for the project.
- **Manual workspaces** start as a blank slate and display only those panels intentionally added by users. Choose a manual workspace when you  care mainly about a fraction of the keys logged in the project, or for a more focused analysis.

The icon next to the name of your workspace indicates how it generates panels:

| Icon | workspace mode |
| ----- | ----- |
| TBD | Automated |
| TBD | Manual |

To change how a workspace generates panels, [reset the workspace](#reset-a-workspace).

## Reset a workspace

To change a workspace's mode:

1. At the top of the workspace, click the `...` menu, then click **Reset workspace**.
2. Specify the [workspace mode](#workspace-modes), either **Automated** or **Manual**.
3. To save your changes, click either **Generate automated workspace** or **Get started**.

## Add panels

You can add panels to your workspace, either globally or at the section level.

To add a panel:

1. To add a panel directly to a section, click the section's `...` menu, then click **+ Add panels**.
2. To add a panel to the top level (for manual workspaces only), click **+ Add panels** at the top of the workspace.
3. Select the type of panel to add.

### Quick add

The **Quick Add** feature allows you to generate a standard panel for any key logged in the project by selecting the key from the list using the search field to find a specific key or path.

In an [automated workspace](#workspace-modes), **Quick Add** is available only if you previously deleted panels.

### Custom add

To add a custom panel to your workspace:

1. Select the type of panel youâ€™d like to create.
2. Follow the prompts to configure the panel.

To learn more about the options for each type of panel, refer to the relevant section below, such as [Line plots](line-plot/intro.md) or [Bar plots](bar-plot.md).

## Manage panels

### Edit a panel

To edit a panel:

1. Click its pencil icon.
2. Modify the panel's settings.
3. To change the panel to a different type, select the type and then configure the settings.
4. Click **Apply**.

### Move a panel

To move a panel:

1. Click the `...` menu for the panel.
2. Click **Move**.
3. If the workspace generates panels automatically, you must select a new section for the panel. If the workspace generates panels manually, you can select a new section or move the panel to the top level of the workspace.

## Duplicate a panel

To duplicate a panel:

1. At the top of the panel, click the `...` menu.
2. Click **Duplicate**.

If desired, you can customize or [move](#move-a-panel) the duplicated panel.

### Remove panels

To remove a panel:

1. Hover your mouse in the upper corner of the panel you want to remove
2. Select the three horizontal dots (**...**) that appear
3. From the dropdown, select **Delete**

To remove all panels from a manual workspace, click its `...` menu, then click **Clear all panels**.

To remove all panels from an automatic or manual workspace, you can [reset the workspace](#reset-a-workspace). Select **Automatic** to start with the default set of panels, or select **Manual** to start with an empty workspace with no panels.

## Manage sections

Sections help you keep your workspace organized so you can focus on your most important data, experiments, and visualizations. You can create new sections, and you can [move a panel](#move-a-panel) from one section to another.

By default, an automated workspace adds panels to sections according to their type, and shows panels in **Chart** and **System** sections by default. When you add a panel to an automated workspace, you must choose its section.

In an automatic workspace, you must choose a section when adding a new panel. You can [move a panel](#move-a-panel) to a different section, but not to the top level of the workspace.

By default, a manual workspace has no sections. You can optionally create panels in sections or at the top level of the workspace.

1. To expand or collapse all sections, click the `...` menu next to the panel search field, then select **Expand all sections** or **Collapse all sections**.
1. To add a section, click **Add section**. To add a new section above or below an existing section, you can instead click the section's `...` menu, then click **New section below** or **New section above**.
1. To delete a section, click its `...` menu, then click **Delete section**. This removes the section and its panels.
