Use workspace panel visualizations to explore your [logged data](/ref/python/log.md) by key, visualize the relationships between hyperparameters and output metrics, and more. 

## Workspace modes

W&B projects support two different workspace modes. The icon next to the workspace name shows its mode. 

| Icon | Workspace mode |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="/images/app_ui/automated_workspace.svg" alt="automated workspace icon" width="32px" /> | **Automated workspaces** automatically generate panels for all keys logged in the project. This can help you get started by visualizing all available data for the project. |
| <img src="/images/app_ui/manual_workspace.svg" alt="manual workspace icon" width="32px" /> | **Manual workspaces** start as blank slates and display only those panels intentionally added by users. Choose a manual workspace when you care mainly about a fraction of the keys logged in the project, or for a more focused analysis. |

To change how a workspace generates panels, [reset the workspace](#reset-a-workspace).

:::tip Undo changes to your workspace
To undo changes to your workspace, click the Undo button (arrow that points left) or type **CMD + Z** (macOS) or **CTRL + Z** (Windows / Linux).

## Reset a workspace

To reset a workspace:

1. At the top of the workspace, click the action menu `...`.
1. Click **Reset workspace**.

## Add panels

You can add panels to your workspace, either globally or at the section level.

To add a panel:

1. To add a panel globally, click **Add panels** in the control bar near the panel search field.
1. To add a panel directly to a section instead, click the section's action `...` menu, then click **+ Add panels**.

### Quick add

**Quick Add** allows you to select a key in the project from a list to generate a standard panel for it.

For an automated workspace with no deleted panels, **Quick add** is not available. You can use **Quick add** to re-add a panel that you deleted.

### Custom panel add

To add a custom panel to your workspace:

1. Select the type of panel youâ€™d like to create.
1. Follow the prompts to configure the panel.

To learn more about the options for each type of panel, refer to the relevant section below, such as [Line plots](line-plot/intro.md) or [Bar plots](bar-plot.md).

## Manage panels

### Edit a panel

To edit a panel:

1. Click its pencil icon.
1. Modify the panel's settings.
1. To change the panel to a different type, select the type and then configure the settings.
1. Click **Apply**.

### Move a panel

To move a panel to a different section, you can use the drag handle on the panel. To select the new section from a list instead:

1. If necessary, create a new section by clicking **Add section** after the last section.
1. Click the  action `...` menu for the panel.
1. Click **Move**, then select a new section.

You can also use the drag handle to rearrange panels within a section.

## Duplicate a panel

To duplicate a panel:

1. At the top of the panel, click the action `...` menu.
1. Click **Duplicate**.

If desired, you can [customize](#edit-a-panel) or [move](#move-a-panel) the duplicated panel.

### Remove panels

To remove a panel:

1. Hover your mouse over the panel.
1. Select the action `...` menu.
1. Click **Delete**.

To remove all panels from a manual workspace, click its action `...` menu, then click **Clear all panels**.

To remove all panels from an automatic or manual workspace, you can [reset the workspace](#reset-a-workspace). Select **Automatic** to start with the default set of panels, or select **Manual** to start with an empty workspace with no panels.

## Manage sections

By default, sections in a workspace reflect the logging hierarchy of your keys. However, in a manual workspace, sections appear only after you start adding panels.

### Add a section

To add a section, click **Add section** after the last section.

To add a new section before or after an existing section, you can instead click the section's action `...` menu, then click **New section below** or **New section above**.

### Rename a section

To rename a section, click its action `...` menu, then click **Rename section**.

### Delete a section

To delete a section, click its `...` menu, then click **Delete section**. This removes the section and its panels.
