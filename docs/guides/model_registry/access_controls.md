# Data governance and access control

Use *protected aliases* to represent key stages of your model development pipeline. Only *Model Registry Administrators* can add, modify, or remove protected aliases. Model registry admins can define and use protected aliases. W&B blocks non admin users from adding or removing protected aliases from model versions.

:::info
Only Team admins or current registry admins can manage the list of registry admins.
:::

For example, suppose you set `staging` and `production` as protected aliases. Any member of your team can add new model versions. However, only admins can add a `staging` or `production` alias.
