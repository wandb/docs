Get Slack notifications when a new model version is linked to the model registry. 


1. Navigate to the W&B Model Registry app at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Select the registered model you want to receive notifications from.
3. Click on the **Connect Slack** button.

4. This will redirect you to an OAuth page with instructions on how to enable W&B in your Slack workspace.




Once you have configured Slack notifications for your team, you can pick and choose registered models to get notifications from. 

:::info
A toggle that reads **New model version linked to...** will appear instead of a **Connect Slack** button if you already have Slack notifications configured for your team.
:::

In the example below, the FMNIST Classification registered model has Slack notifications turned on. A message is automatically posted to the connected Slack channel when a new model version is linked to this registered model.
