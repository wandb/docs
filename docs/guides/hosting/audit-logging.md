# Audit logs
Use audit logs to track and understand activity within your team. Audit logs sync to your bucket store every 10 minutes. Optionally, download your audit logs and view them with your preferred tool, such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), and more.

## View audit logs
To view the audit logs for your W&B server instance, follow these steps:
1. Admin users can go to `<wandb-server-url>/admin/audit_logs`
2. Pass in the following URL parameters:
    - `numDays` : logs will be fetch starting from `today - numdays` to most recent; defaults to `0`
    - `anonymize` : if set to `true`, remove any PII; defaults to `false`

Note that only W&B server admins are allowed to request this information. If you are not an admin you will an authentication error. The response contains new-line separated JSON objects. Objects will have fields described in the schema.

All historical audit logs are stored in the storage bucket that backs your W&B Server installation. One file is uploaded per day. The files contain new-line separated JSON objects. These logs have the same format as the ones returned by the end points, except that they do not contain any PII for security reasons.

To view your historical audit logs, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to your `/wandb-audit-logs` directory in your bucket.
2. Download the files for the period you are interested in.
