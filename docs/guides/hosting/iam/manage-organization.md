:::

If you are looking to simplify user management in your organization, refer to [Automate user and team management](./automate_iam.md).

<!-- W&B assigns an Admin role to new users within an organization by default.  -->

### Auto provision users

A person in your company (someone who has the same domain as your company) can sign in to your W&B Organization with Single Sign-On (SSO) if SSO is set up and the SSO provider permits it. SSO is avalible for all Enterprise licenses. 

:::tip enable SSO for authentication
W&B strongly recommends and encourages that users authenticate using Single Sign-On (SSO). Reach out to your W&B team to enable SSO for your organization. 

To learn more about how to setup SSO with Dedicated cloud or Self-managed instances, refer to [SSO with OIDC](./sso.md) or [SSO with LDAP](./ldap.md).
:::

W&B assigned auto-provisioning users "Member" roles by default. You can change the role of auto-provisioned users at any time.

Auto-provisioning users with SSO is on by default for Dedicated cloud instances and Self-Managed deployments. You can turn off auto provisioning. Turning auto provisioning off enables you to selectively add specific users to your W&B organization.

The proceeding tabs describe how to turn off SSO based on deployment type:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="dedicated"
  values={[
    {label: 'Dedicated Cloud', value: 'dedicated'},
    {label: 'Self Manged', value: 'self_managed'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="dedicated">

Reach out to your W&B team if you are on Dedicated Cloud instance and you want to turn off auto provisioning with SSO.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="self_managed">

Use the W&B Console to turn off auto provisioning with SSO:

1. Navigate to `https://<org-name>.io/console/settings/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name.
2. Choose **Security** 
3. Select the **Disable SSO Provisioning** to turn off auto provisioning with SSO.

<!-- For Self-Managed deployments, you can configure the setting `DISABLE_SSO_PROVISIONING=true` to turn off auto provisioning with SSO.  -->


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



:::tip 
Auto provisioning with SSO is useful for adding users to an organization at scale because organization administrators do not need to generate individual user invitations.
:::


### Domain capture
Domain capture helps your employees join the your companies organization to ensure new users do not create assets outside of your company jurisdiction. 

:::note Domains must be unique
Domains are unique identifiers. This means that you can not use a domain that is already in use by another organization. 
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="saas"
  values={[
    {label: 'Multi-tenant SaaS Cloud', value: 'saas'},
    {label: 'Dedicated or Self Managed', value: 'dedicated'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="saas">

Domain capture lets you automatically add people with a company email address, such as  `@example.com`, to your W&B SaaS cloud organization. This helps all your employees join the right organization and ensures that new users do not create assets outside of your company jurisdiction. 


The proceeding table summarizes the behavior of new and existing users with and without domain capture enabled:

| | With domain capture | Without domain capture |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| New users | Users who sign up for W&B from verified domains are automatically added as members to your organization’s default team. They can choose additional teams to join at sign up, if team joining is enabled for these teams. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation. | Users can create W&B accounts without knowing there is a centralized organization available. | 
| Invited users | Invited users automatically join your organization when accepting your invite. Invited users are not automatically added as members to your organization’s default team. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation. | Invited users automatically join your organization when accepting your invite. They can still join other organizations and teams with an invitation.| 
| Existing users | Existing users with verified email addresses from your domains can join your organization’s teams within the W&B App. All data that existing users create before joining your organization will remain.

6. Click the **Claim email domain** button.

You must enable domain matching within a team's settings before you can automatically assign non-invited new users to that team.

2. Select **Team settings** in the global navigation on the left side of the team's dashboard.
3. Within the **Privacy** section, toggle the "Recommend new users with matching email domains join this team upon signing up" option.


 </TabItem>
 
<TabItem value="dedicated">

Reach out to your W&B Account Team if you use Dedicated or Self-Managed deployment type to configure domain capture. Once configured, your W&B SaaS instance automatically prompts users who create a W&B account with your company email address to contact your administrator to request access to your Dedicated or Self-Managed instance.

| | With domain capture | Without domain capture |
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| New users | Users who sign up for W&B on SaaS cloud from verified domains are automatically prompted to contact an administrator with an email address you customize. They can still create an organizations on SaaS cloud to trial the product. | Users can create W&B SaaS cloud accounts without learning their company has a centralized dedicated instance. |

If you use an API key from a service account for your team, ensure to set the environment variable `WANDB_USERNAME`  to correctly attribute runs to the appropriate user. |
| Custom Roles (Enterprise-only feature)   | Custom roles allow organization administrators to compose new roles by inheriting from the preceding View-Only or Member roles, and adding additional permissions to achieve fine-grained access control. Team administrators can then assign any of those custom roles to users in their respective teams. Refer to [this article](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/announcements/reports/Introducing-Custom-Roles-for-W-B-Teams--Vmlldzo2MTMxMjQ3) for details. |

<!-- :::note
W&B recommends to have more than one admin in a team. It is a best practice to ensure that admin operations can continue when the primary admin is not available.

:::note
Only enterprise licenses on Dedicated Cloud or Self-managed deployment can assign custom roles to members in a team.
