# Access management


## Instance Admins
The first user to sign up after the W&B Server instance is initially deployed, is automatically assigned the instance `admin` role. The admin can then add additional users to the organization and create teams.

:::note
W&B recommends to have more than one instance admin in an organization. It is a best practice to ensure that admin operations can continue when the primary admin is not available.
