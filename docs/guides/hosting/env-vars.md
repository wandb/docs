In addition to configuring instance level settings via the System Settings admin UI, W&B also provides a way to configure these values via code using Environment Variables. Also, refer to [advanced configuration for IAM](./iam/advanced_env_vars.md).

:::info

Use the GORILLA_DATA_RETENTION_PERIOD environment variable cautiously. Data is removed immediately once the environment variable is set. We also recommend that you backup both the database and the storage bucket before you enable this flag.
