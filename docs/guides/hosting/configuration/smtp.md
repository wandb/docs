# Configuring SMTP
# SMTP Configuration

In W&B server, adding users to the instance or team will trigger an email invite. To send these email invites, W&B uses a third-party mail server. In some cases, organizations might have strict policies on traffic leaving the corporate network and hence causing these email invites to never be sent to the end user. W&B server offers an option to configure sending these invite emails via an internal SMTP server.
