# User Management

Weights & Biases strongly recommends and encourages user management via Single Sign-On (SSO). To learn more about how to setup SSO with W&B Server, refer to the [SSO Configuration documentation](./sso.md).

:::tip
Users are classified as either an _admin_ or _member_ when using W&B. Admins can add and remove other admins or team members. A team member is invited by email by the team admin. A team member cannot invite other members.

For more information on roles and permissions, [see Team Roles and Permissions](../app/features/teams#team-roles-and-permissions).
:::

## Instance Admins

The first user to sign up to W&B, after you have deployed the W&B Server, will automatically be assigned admin permissions. The admin can then add additional users to the instance and create teams.

## Invite Users

Invite fellow admin or members from the `https://<YOUR-WANDB-URL>/admin/users` page.

1.  Navigate to `https://<YOUR-WANDB-URL>/admin/users`.

An invite link will be sent to the user by email. The new admin or member will now have access to the W&B instance.

W&B uses third-party email server to send these invite emails. If your organization firewall rules prohibit from sending traffic outside the corporate network, W&B provides an option to set up internal SMTP server. Please refer to [these instructions](./configure-smtp.md) to setup the SMTP server.

<!-- To do: Add this doc -->
<!-- Refer to SMTP configuration documentation for instructions on how to do this. -->
