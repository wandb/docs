# W&B Server Hosting Options

There are three ways to deploy W&B Server:

- **W&B managed Dedicated Cloud**: A fully managed solution hosted and maintained by W&B on W&B Cloud
- **Customer managed OnPrem Private Cloud**: A self managed solution hosted and maintained by customer on their Private Cloud
- **Customer managed OnPrem Bare Metal**: A self managed solution hosted and maintained by customer on their Bare Metal infrastructure

## Obtain your license

Talk to your W&B Sales Team to obtain a license. The sales team will provide a URL that you can use to create a local license and deployment.

The URL will redirect you to a **Get a License for W&B Local** form. Provide the following information:

1. Choose a deployment type from the **Choose Platform** step.
2. Select the owner of the license or add a new organization in the **Basic Information** step.
3. Provide a name for the instance in the **Name of Instance** field and optionally provide a description in the **Description** field in the **Get a License** step.
4. Select the **Generate License Key** button.

A page with an overview of your deployment along with licenses associated to the instance will be displayed.

For information on how to set up your deployment type, see [our How-to guides](/guides/hosting/how-to-guides) section.
