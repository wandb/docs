# W&B Server

Deploy Weights & Biases in a resource isolated environment managed by W&B or by yourself. W&B Server is shipped as a packaged Docker image that can be deployed easily into any underlying infrastructure. There are several ways to install and host the W&B Server in different environments.

:::info
W&B Server is an option available only for Enterprise-tier customers.
:::

With W&B Server you can configure and leverage features such as:

- [Secure Storage Connector](/guides/hosting/secure-storage-connector)
- [Single Sign-On](/guides/hosting/sso)
- [Role-based Access Control via LDAP](/guides/hosting/ldap)
- [Audit Logs](/guides/hosting/audit-logging)
- [User Management](/guides/hosting/manage-users)
- [Prometheus Monitoring](/guides/hosting/prometheus-logging)
- [Slack Alerts](/guides/hosting/slack-alerts) and more.

The following sections of the documentation describes different options on how to install W&B Server, the shared responsibility model, step-by-step installation and configuration guides.

## Recommendations

W&B recommends the following when configuring W&B Server:

1. Run the W&B Server Docker container with an external storage and an external MySQL database in order to preserve the state outside of a container. This protects the data from being accidentally deleted if the container dies or crashes.
2. Leverage Kubernetes to run the W&B Server Docker image and expose the `wandb` service.
3. Set up and manage a scale-able file system if you plan on using W&B Server for production-related work.

## System Requirements

W&B Server requires a machine with at least

- 4 cores of CPU &
- 8GB of memory (RAM)

Your W&B data will be saved on a persistent volume or external database, ensuring that it is preserved across different versions of the container.

:::tip
For enterprise customers, W&B offers extensive technical support and frequent installation updates for privately hosted instances.
