W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML](./artifacts/intro.md) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations](./tables/intro.md).
- [Document and share](./reports/intro.md) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data](../guides/app/features/panels/query-panel/intro.md) that serve your custom needs.
