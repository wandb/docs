Use W&B Artifacts to track and version data as the inputs and outputs of your [W&B Runs](../runs/intro.md). For example, a model training run might take in a dataset as input and produce a trained model as output. In addition to logging hyperparameters, metadata and metrics to a run, you can use an artifact to log, track and version the dataset used to train the model as input and another artifact for the resulting model checkpoints as outputs.

## Use cases
You can use artifacts throughout your entire ML workflow as inputs and outputs of [runs](../runs/intro.md). You can use datasets, models, or even other artifacts as inputs for processing.

The proceeding code snippets are meant to be run in order.

## Create an artifact

Create an artifact with four lines of code:
1. Create a [W&B run](../runs/intro.md).
2. Create an artifact object with the [`wandb.Artifact`](../../ref/python/artifact.md) API.
3. Add one or more files, such as a model file or dataset, to your artifact object.
4. Log your artifact to W&B.

For example, the proceeding code snippet shows how to log a file called `dataset.h5` to an artifact called `example_artifact`:

```python
import wandb

run = wandb.init(project = "artifacts-example", job_type = "add-dataset")
artifact = wandb.Artifact(name = "example_artifact", type = "dataset")
artifact.add_file(local_path = "./dataset.h5", name = "training_dataset")
artifact.save()

# Logs the artifact version "my_data" as a dataset with data from dataset.h5
```

:::tip
See the [track external files](./track-external-files.md) page for information on how to add references to files or directories stored in external object storage, like an Amazon S3 bucket. 
:::

## Download an artifact
Indicate the artifact you want to mark as input to your run with the [`use_artifact`](../../ref/python/run.md#use_artifact) method.

Following the preceding code snippet, this next code block shows how to use the `training_dataset` artifact: 

```python
artifact = run.use_artifact("training_dataset:latest") #returns a run object using the "my_data" artifact
```
This returns an artifact object.

Next, use the returned object to download all contents of the artifact:

```python
datadir = artifact.download() #downloads the full "my_data" artifact to the default directory.
```

:::tip
You can pass a custom path into the `root` [parameter](../../ref/python/artifact.md) to download an artifact to a specific directory. For alternate ways to download artifacts and to see additional parameters, see the guide on [downloading and using artifacts](./download-and-use-an-artifact.md)
