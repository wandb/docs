# Weights & Biases

Use the W&B machine learning platform to build better models faster. 

Set up W&B in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your ML pipeline with the confidence that experiments, models, and datasets are tracked in a reliable system of record.

## Start tracking models
- **[Intro Notebook](http://wandb.me/intro)**: Track your first experiment with W&B with sample code
- **[Integrations](./integrations/intro.md)**: Get started quickly with our integrations, which simplify tracking with popular libraries and frameworks, such as:
  - [PyTorch Lightning](./integrations/lightning.md)
  - [Hugging Face](./integrations/huggingface.md)
  - [XGBoost](./integrations/xgboost.md)



## W&B Products

## Resources

If this is your first time using W&B we suggest you explore the following:

1. Experience W&B in action, [run an example introduction project with Google Colab](http://wandb.me/intro).
1. Read through the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) for a quick overview of how and where to add W&B to your code.
1. Read [How does W&B work?](#how-does-weights--biases-work) This section provides an overview of the building blocks of W&B.
1. Explore our [Integrations guide](./integrations/intro.md) and our [W&B Easy Integration YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD80i8An1OEGDADxOBaH71ZwieZ9nmPGC) playlist for information on how to integrate W&B with your preferred machine learning framework.
1. View the [API Reference guide](../ref/README.md) for technical specifications about the W&B Python Library, CLI, and Weave operations.
