# Weights & Biases

Use the Weights & Biases machine learning platform to build better models faster. 

Track your scripts with [`wandb`](https://github.com/wandb/wandb) in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your ML pipeline with the confidence that experiments, models, and datasets are tracked in a reliable system of record.

## Start tracking models
- **[Intro Notebook](http://wandb.me/intro)**: Track your first experiment with W&B with sample code
- **[Integrations](./integrations/intro.md)**: Get started quickly with our integrations, which simplify tracking with popular libraries and frameworks, such as [PyTorch Lightning](./integrations/lightning.md), [Hugging Face](./integrations/huggingface.md), [XGBoost](./integrations/xgboost.md), and more.


Here's an overview of the tools we offer for machine learning workflows, which support enterprise hosting.

## Resources

- **[W&B Server](./hosting/intro.md)**: Learn about options for secure deployments of W&B in dedicated cloud or customer-managed infrastructure.
- **[API Reference](../ref/README.md)**: Check the generated documentation from the open source [`wandb` library](https://github.com/wandb/wandb).
- **[Tutorials](../tutorials/intro_to_tutorials.md)**: Learn to use W&B with interactive code examples.
