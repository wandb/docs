# Automate workflows
Create an automation to trigger workflow steps based on an event you configure. For example, you can create an event that automatically tests new models versions added to a registered model. Automations are executed on your own infrastructure with [W&B Launch](../launch/intro.md).  

:::tip
Before you get started, ensure you create a W&B Launch [job](../launch/create-job.md), [queue](../launch/create-queue.md), and have an [agent polling](../launch/run-agent.md). For more information, see the [Launch documentation](../launch/intro.md).

## Automation event types
There are two types of events that can trigger an action:

1. **A new version is added to a registered model**: Each time a new model version is linked, this automation will run. This is useful for Model CI — run testing on each new model candidate. 

2. **An artifact alias is added**: Specify an alias that represents a special step of your workflow, like `deploy`, and any time a new model version has that alias applied, it will automatically run this automation. This would let you automatically trigger a deployment job.

## Create an automation
1. Navigate to the W&B Model Registry app at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Select **View details** next to the name of the registered model you want to create an automation for.
3. Scroll down the page to the **Automations** section.

4. Click on the **New automation** button. 
5. A UI modal will appear. Complete the steps described in the modal.

Use [Launch](../launch/intro.md) to set up a connection to your own compute resources, whether that’s a GPU machine at your desk or a scalable cloud Kubernetes cluster. -->
