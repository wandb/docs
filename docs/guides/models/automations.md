# Automations for Model CI/CD

Create an automation to trigger workflow steps, such as automated model testing and deployment. To create an automation, define the [action](#action-types) you want to occur based on an [event type](#event-types).

For example, you can create a trigger that automatically deploys a model to GitHub when you add a new version of a registered model.

## Event types
An *event* is a change that takes place in the W&B ecosystem. The Model Registry supports two event types: **Linking a new artifact to a registered model** and **Adding a new alias to a version of the registered model**.

:::tip
Use the **Linking a new artifact to a registered model** event type to test new model candidates. Use the **Adding a new alias to a version of the registered model** event type to specify an alias that represents a special step of your workflow, like `deploy`, and any time a new model version has that alias applied.
:::


## Action types
An action is a responsive mutation (internal or external) that occurs as a result of some trigger. There are two types of actions you can create in the Model Registry: webhooks and [W&B Launch Jobs](../launch/intro.md).

* Webhooks: Communicate with an external web server from W&B with HTTP requests.
* W&B Launch job: [Jobs](../launch/create-job.md) are reusable, configurable run templates that allow you to quickly launch new [runs](../runs/intro.md) locally on your desktop or external compute resources such as Kubernetes on EKS, Amazon SageMaker, and more. 

<!-- :::tip
Question: When should I use a webhook as opposed to a W&B Launch job? Answer: [INSERT]
::: -->

The following sections describe how to create an automation with webhooks and W&B Launch.

## Create a webhook automation 
Automate a webhook based on an action with the W&B App UI. To do this, you will first establish a webhook, then you will configure the webhook automation.

### Add a secret for authentication
Define a team secret to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data transmitted from payloads. 

:::tip
Skip this section if one of the following applies to your use case:
- The external server you will send the HTTP POST request does not use secrets.
- You are do not use the [W&B Public Cloud](../hosting/intro.md).
:::


1. Navigate to the W&B App UI.
2. Click on **Team Settings**.
3. Scroll down the page until you find the **Team secrets** section.
4. Click on the **New secret** button.
5. A modal will appear. Provide a name for your secret in the **Secret name** field.
6. Add your secret into the **Secret** field. 

:::info
Only W&B Admins can create, edit, or delete a secret.
:::

Once you create a secret, you can access that secret in your W&B workflows with `$`.

### Configure a webhook
Before you can use a webhook, you will first need to configure that webhook in the W&B App UI.

:::info
Only W&B Admins can configure a webhook for a W&B Team.
:::

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI.
2. Click on **Team Settings**.
4. Scroll down the page until you find the **Webhooks** section.
5. Click on the **New webhook** button.  
6. Provide a name for your webhook in the **Name** field.
7. Provide the endpoint URL for the webhook in the **URL** field.


### Add a webhook 
Once you have a webhook configured and (optionally) a secret, navigate to the Model Registry App at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).

1. From the **Event type** dropdown, select an [event type](#event-types).
![](/images/models/webhook_select_event.png)
2. (Optional) If you selected **A new version is added to a registered model** event, provide the name of a registered model from the **Registered model** dropdown. 
![](/images/models/webhook_new_version_reg_model.png)
3. Select **Webhooks** from the **Action type** dropdown. 
4. Click on the **Next step** button.
5. Select a webhook from the **Webhook** dropdown.
![](/images/models/webhooks_select_from_dropdown.png)
6. (Optional) Provide a payload in the JSON expression editor. See the [Example payload](#example-payloads) section for common use case examples.
7. Click on **Next step**.
8. Provide a name for your webhook automation in the **Automation name** field. 
![](/images/models/webhook_name_automation.png)
9. (Optional) Provide a description for your webhook. 
10. Click on the **Create automation** button.



### Example payloads

The following tabs demonstrate example payloads based on common use cases. Within the examples they reference the following keys to refer to condition objects in the payload parameters:
* `${event_type}` Refers to the type of event that triggered the action.
* `${event_author}` Refers to the user that triggered the action.
* `${artifact_version}` Refers to the specific artifact version that triggered the action. Passed as an artifact instance.
* `${artifact_version_string}` Refers to the specific artifact version that triggered the action. Passed as a string.
* `${artifact_collection_name}` Refers to the name of the artifact collection that the artifact version is linked to.
* `${project_name}` Refers to the name of the project owning the mutation that triggered the action.
* `${entity_name}` Refers to the name of the entity owning the mutation that triggered the action.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="github"
  values={[
    {label: 'GitHub repository dispatch', value: 'github'},
    {label: 'Microsoft Teams notification', value: 'microsoft'},
    {label: 'Slack notifications', value: 'slack'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="github">

  
  Send a repository dispatch from W&B to trigger a GitHub action. For example, suppose you have workflow that accepts a repository dispatch as a trigger for the `on` key:

  ```yaml
  on:
    repository_dispatch:
      types: LINK_MODEL
  ```

  The payload for the repository might look something like:

  ```json
  {
    "event_type": "${event_type}",
    "client_payload": 
    {
      "event_author": "${event_author}",
      "artifact_version": "${artifact_version}",
      "artifact_version_string": "${artifact_version_string}",
      "artifact_collection_name": "${artifact_collection_name}",
      "project_name": "${project_name}",
      "entity_name": "${entity_name}"
      }
  }

  ```

  Where template strings render depending on the event or model version the automation is configured for. `${event_type}` will render as either "LINK_ARTIFACT" or "ADD_ARTIFACT_ALIAS". See below for an example mapping:

  ```json
  ${event_type} --> "LINK_ARTIFACT" or "ADD_ARTIFACT_ALIAS"
  ${event_author} --> "<wandb-user>"
  ${artifact_version} --> "wandb-artifact://_id/QXJ0aWZhY3Q6NTE3ODg5ODg3""
  ${artifact_version_string} --> "<entity>/model-registry/<registered_model_name>:<alias>"
  ${artifact_collection_name} --> "<registered_model_name>"
  ${project_name} --> "model-registry"
  ${entity_name} --> "<entity>"
  ```

  Use template strings to dynamically pass context from W&B to GitHub Actions and other tools. If those tools can call Python scripts, they can consume the registered model artifacts through the [W&B API](../artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact.md).

  For more information about repository dispatch, see the [official documentation on the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repository-dispatch).  

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="microsoft">

  Configure an ‘Incoming Webhook' to get the webhook URL for your Teams Channel by configuring. The following is an example payload:
  
  ```json 
  {
  "@type": "MessageCard",
  "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
  "summary": "New Notification",
  "sections": [
    {
      "activityTitle": "Notification from WANDB",
      "text": "This is an example message sent via Teams webhook.",
      "facts": [
        {
          "name": "Author",
          "value": "${event_author}"
        },
        {
          "name": "Event Type",
          "value": "${event_type}"
        }
      ],
      "markdown": true
    }
  ]
  }
  ```
  You can use template strings to inject W&B data into your payload at the time of execution (as shown in the Teams example above).


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="slack">

  Setup your Slack app and add an incoming webhook integration with the instructions highlighted in the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). Ensure that you have the secret specified under `Bot User OAuth Toke`n as your W&B webhook’s access token. 
  
  The following is an example payload:

  ```json
    {
        "text": "New alert from WANDB!",
    "blocks": [
        {
                "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "Registry event: ${event_type}"
            }
        },
            {
                "type":"section",
                "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "New version: ${artifact_version_string}"
            }
            },
            {
            "type": "divider"
        },
            {
                "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "Author: ${event_author}"
            }
            }
        ]
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

11. (Optional) Provide a description for your webhook. 
12. Click on the **Create automation** button.


## View automation

View automations associated to a registered model from the W&B App UI. 

1. Navigate to the Model Registry App at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Select on a registered model. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Automations** section.

Within the Automations section you can find the following properties of automations created for the model you selected:

- **Trigger type**: The type of trigger that was configured.
- **Action type**: The action type that triggers the automation. Available options are Webhooks and Launch.
- **Action name**: The action name you provided when you created the automation.
- **Queue**: The name of the queue the job was enqueued to. This field is left empty if you selected a webhook action type.

## Delete an automation
Delete an automation associated with a model. Actions in progress are not affected if you delete that automation before the action completes. 

1. Navigate to the Model Registry App at [https://wandb.ai/registry/model](https://wandb.ai/registry/model).
2. Click on a registered model. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Automations** section.
4. Hover your mouse next to the name of the automation and click on the kebob (three vertical dots) menu. 
5. Select **Delete**.

<!-- # Automate workflows
Create an automation to trigger workflow steps based on an event you configure. For example, you can create an event that automatically tests new models versions added to a registered model. Automations are executed on your own infrastructure with [W&B Launch](../launch/intro.md).  

:::tip
Before you get started, ensure you create a W&B Launch [job](../launch/create-job.md), [queue](../launch/create-queue.md), and have an [agent polling](../launch/run-agent.md). For more information, see the [Launch documentation](../launch/intro.md).

:::

## Automation event types
There are two types of events that can trigger an action:

1. **A new version is added to a registered model**: Each time a new model version is linked, this automation will run. This is useful for Model CI — run testing on each new model candidate. 

2. **An artifact alias is added**: Specify an alias that represents a special step of your workflow, like `deploy`, and any time a new model version has that alias applied, it will automatically run this automation. This would let you automatically trigger a deployment job.
