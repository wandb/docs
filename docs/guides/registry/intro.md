:::info
W&B Registry is now in public preview. Visit [this](#enable-wb-registry) section to learn how to enable it for your deployment type.
:::

W&B Registry is a curated central repository that stores and provides versioning, aliases, lineage tracking, and governance of models and datasets. Registry allows individuals and teams across the entire organization to share and collaboratively manage the lifecycle of all models, datasets and other artifacts. As the single source of truth for which models are in production, Registry provides the foundation for an effective CI/CD pipeline by identifying the right models to reproduce, retrain, evaluate, and deploy.

Use W&B Registry to:

- [Bookmark](./link_version.md) your best artifacts for each machine learning task.
- [Automate](../model_registry/model-registry-automations.md) downstream processes and model CI/CD.
- Track an [artifact’s lineage](../model_registry/model-lineage.md) and audit the history of changes to production artifacts.
- [Configure](./configure_registry.md) viewer, member, or administrator access to a registry for all organization users.
- Quickly find or reference important artifacts with a unique identifier known as aliases.
- Use [tags](./organize-with-tags.md) to label, group, and discover assets in your Registry. 

## How it works

Track and publish your staged artifacts to W&B Registry in a few steps:

1. Log an artifact version: In your training or experiment script, add a few lines of code to save the artifact to a W&B run.
2. Link to registry: Bookmark the most relevant and valuable artifact version by linking it to a registry.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to log and link a model to the model registry inside W&B Registry:

```python
import wandb
import random

# Start a new W&B run to track your experiment
run = wandb.init(project="registry_quickstart") 

# Simulate logging model metrics
run.log({"acc": random.random()})

# Create a simulated model file
with open("my_model.txt", "w") as f:
   f.write("Model: " + str(random.random()))

# log and link the model to the model registry inside W&B Registry
logged_artifact = run.log_artifact(artifact_or_path="./my_model.txt", name="gemma-finetuned-3twsov9e", type="model")
run.link_artifact(artifact=logged_artifact, target_path=f"<INSERT-ORG-NAME>/wandb-registry-model/registry-quickstart-collection"),

run.finish()
```

## Enable W&B Registry

Based on your deployment type, satisfy the following conditions to enable W&B Registry:

| Deployment type | How to enable |
| ----- | ----- |
| Multi-tenant Cloud | No action required. W&B Registry is available on the W&B App. |
| Dedicated Cloud | Contact your account team. The Solutions Architect (SA) Team enables W&B Registry within your instance's operator console. Ensure your instance is on server release version 0.59.2 or newer.|
| Self-Managed   | Enable the environment variable called `ENABLE_REGISTRY_UI`. To learn more about enabling environment variables in server, visit [these docs](/guides/hosting/env-vars). In self-managed instances, your infrastructure administrator should enable this environment variable and set it to `true`. Ensure your instance is on server release version 0.59.2 or newer.|


## Resources to get started

Depending on your use case, explore the following resources to get started with the W&B Registry:

* Check out the tutorial video:
    * [Getting started with Registry from Weights & Biases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4XkVOsjIeM)
* Take the W&B [Model CI/CD](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/enterprise-model-management) course and learn how to:
    * Use W&B Registry to manage and version your artifacts, track lineage, and promote models through different lifecycle stages.
    * Automate your model management workflows using webhooks.
    * See how Registry integrates with external ML systems and tools in your model development lifecycle for model evaluation, monitoring, and deployment.

## Migrating from the legacy Model Registry to W&B Registry

The legacy Model Registry is scheduled for deprecation with the exact date not yet decided. Before deprecating the legacy Model Registry, W&B will migrate the contents of the legacy Model Registry to the W&B Registry. 


See [Migrating from legacy Model Registry](./model_registry_eol.md) for more information about the migration process from the legacy Model Registry to W&B Registry.

Until the migration occurs, W&B supports both the legacy Model Registry and the new Registry. 

:::info
To view the legacy Model Registry, navigate to the Model Registry in the W&B App. A banner appears at the top of the page that enables you to use the legacy Model Registry App UI.

Reach out to support@wandb.com with any questions or to speak to the W&B Product Team about any concerns about the migration.
