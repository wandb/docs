Programmatically or interactively link artifact versions to a registry. 

W&B recommends that you check the artifact types that the registry permits. Each registry controls the types of artifacts that can be linked to that registry.

:::info
The term "type" refers to the artifact object type. When you create an artifact object ([`wandb.Artifact`](../../ref/python/artifact.md)), or log an artifact ([`wandb.run.log_artifact`](../../ref/python/run.md#log_artifact)), you specify a type for the `type` parameter. 
<!-- If you are familiar with Python, you can think of artifact types in W&B as having similar functions as Python data types.  -->
:::

As an example, by default, the Model registry only permits artifacts objects that have a "model" type. W&B will not permit you to link a dataset artifact type object if you try to link it to the Model registry.

:::info
When you link an artifact to a registry, this "publishes" that artifact to that registry. Any user that has access to that registry can access linked artifact versions when you link an artifact to a collection.

In other words, linking an artifact to a registry collection brings that artifact version from a private, project-level scope, to the shared organization level scope.
:::

## How to link an artifact version 

Based on your use case, follow the instructions described in the tabs below to link an artifact version.

Programmatically link an artifact version to a collection with [`link_artifact`](../../ref/python/run.md#link_artifact). Before you link an artifact to a collection, ensure that the registry that the collection belongs to already exists.


Use the `target_path` parameter to specify the collection and registry you want to link the artifact version to. The target path consists of:

```text
{ORG_ENTITY_NAME}/wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/{COLLECTION_NAME}
```

Copy and paste the code snippet below to link an artifact version to a collection within an existing registry. Replace values enclosed in `<>` with your own:

```python
import wandb

TEAM_ENTITY_NAME = "<team_entity_name>"
ORG_ENTITY_NAME = "<org_entity_name>"

REGISTRY_NAME = "<registry_name>"  
COLLECTION_NAME = "<collection_name>"

run = wandb.init(
        entity=TEAM_ENTITY_NAME, project="<project_name>")

artifact = wandb.Artifact(name="<artifact_name>", type="<collection_type>")
artifact.add_file(local_path="<local_path_to_artifact>")

target_path=f"{ORG_ENTITY_NAME}/wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/{COLLECTION_NAME}"
run.link_artifact(artifact = artifact, target_path = target_path)
```

If you want to link an artifact version to the **Models** registry or the **Dataset** registry, set the artifact type to `"model"` or `"dataset"`, respectively.


For example, the proceeding code snippet simulates logging a model artifact called "my_model.txt" to a collection called "Example ML Task" within the model registry:

```python
import wandb

TEAM_ENTITY_NAME = "<team_entity_name>"
ORG_ENTITY_NAME = "<org_entity_name>"

REGISTRY_NAME = "model" 
COLLECTION_NAME = "Example ML Task"

COLLECTION_TYPE = "model"


with wandb.init(entity=TEAM_ENTITY_NAME, project="link_quickstart") as run:
  with open("my_model.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("simulated model file")

  logged_artifact = run.log_artifact("./my_model.txt", "artifact-name", type=COLLECTION_TYPE)
  run.link_artifact(
    artifact=logged_artifact,
    target_path=f"{ORG_ENTITY_NAME}/wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/{COLLECTION_NAME}"
  )
```

2. Hover your mouse next to the name of the collection you want to link an artifact version to.
3. Select the meatball menu icon (three horizontal dots) next to  **View details**.
4. From the dropdown, select **Link new version**.
5. From the sidebar that appears, select the name of a team from the **Team** dropdown.
5. From the **Project** dropdown, select the name of the project that contains your artifact. 
6. From the **Artifact** dropdown, select the name of the artifact. 
7. From the **Version** dropdown, select the artifact version you want to link to the collection.

<!-- :::tip Linked vs source artifact versions
* Source version: the artifact version inside a team's project that is logged to a [run](../runs/intro.md).
* Linked version: the artifact version that is published to the registry. This is a pointer to the source artifact, and is the exact same artifact version, just made available in the scope of the registry.
::: -->

## Troubleshooting 

Below are some common things to double check if you are not able to link an artifact. 

### Logging artifacts from a personal account

Artifacts logged to W&B with a personal entity can not be linked to the registry. Make sure that you log artifacts using a team entity within your organization. Only artifacts logged within an organization's team can be linked to the organization's registry. 


:::tip 
Ensure that you you log an artifact with a team entity if you want to link that artifact to a registry.
:::

#### Find your team entity

W&B uses the name of your team as the team's entity. For example, if your team is called "team-awesome", your team entity is `team-awesome`.

You can confirm the name of your team by:

1. Navigate to your team's W&B profile page.
2. Copy the site's URL. It has the form of `https://wandb.ai/<team>`. Where `<team>` is the both the name of your team and the team's entity.

#### Log from a team entity
1. Specify the team as the entity when you initialize a run with [`wandb.init()`](/ref/python/init). If you do not specify the `entity` when you initialize a run, the run uses your default entity which may or may not be your team entity. 
  ```python 
  import wandb   

  run = wandb.init(
    entity='<team_entity_name>', 
    project='<project_name>'
    )
  ```
2. Log the artifact to the run either with run.log_artifact or by creating an Artifact object and then adding files to it with  :

    ```python
    artifact = wandb.Artifact(name="<artifact_name>", type="<collection_type>")
    run.log_artifact(artifact)
    ```
    For more information on how to log artifacts, see [Construct artifacts](../artifacts/construct-an-artifact.md).
3. If an artifact is logged to your personal entity, you will need to re-log it to an entity within your organization.


### Organization names with team name collisions

W&B appends a unique hash to the organization name to avoid naming collisions with existing entities. The combination of the name and the unique hash is known as an organizational identifier or `ORG_ENTITY_NAME`.

For example, if your organization name is "reviewco" and you also have a team named "reviewco", W&B appends a hash to the organization name that results in an `ORG_ENTITY_NAME` named `reviewco_XYZ123456`. 

:::tip 
When linking to a registry with the Python SDK, always use the `ORG_ENTITY_NAME` format in the `target_path`.
:::

For example, the target path might look like `reviewco_XYZ123456/wandb-registry-model/my-collection`.



### Confirm the path of a registry in the W&B App UI

There are two ways to confirm the path of a registry with the UI: create an empty collection and view the collection details or copy and paste the autogenerated code on the collection's home page.

#### Copy and paste autogenerated code

1. Navigate to the Registry app at https://wandb.ai/registry/.
2. Click the registry you want to link an artifact to.
3. At the top of the page, you will see an autogenerated code block. 
4. Copy and paste this into your code, ensure to replace the last part of the path with the name of your collection.

![](/images/registry/get_autogenerated_code.gif)

#### Create an empty collection

1. Navigate to the Registry app at https://wandb.ai/registry/.
2. Click the registry you want to link an artifact to.
4. Click on the empty collection. If an empty collection does not exist, create a new collection.
5. Within the code snippet that appears, identify the `target_path` field within `run.link_artifact()`.
6. (Optional) Delete the collection.

![](/images/registry/check_empty_collection.gif)

For example, after completing the steps outlined, you find the code block with the `target_path` parameter:

```python
target_path = 
      "smle-registries-bug-bash/wandb-registry-Golden Datasets/raw_images"
```

Breaking this down into its components, you can see what you will need to use to create the path to link your artifact programmatically:

```python
ORG_ENTITY_NAME = "smle-registries-bug-bash"
REGISTRY_NAME = "Golden Datasets"
COLLECTION_NAME = "raw_images"
```

:::note
Ensure that you replace the name of the collection from the temporary collection with the name of the collection that you want to link your artifact to.
