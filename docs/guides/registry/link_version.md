# Link an artifact version to a registry

Programmatically or interactively link artifact versions to a registry.

:::info
When you link an artifact to a registry, this "publishes" that artifact to that registry. Any user that has access to that registry can access linked artifact versions when you link an artifact to a collection.

In other words, linking an artifact to a registry collection brings that artifact version from a private, project-level scope, to the shared organization level scope.
:::

Based on your use case, follow the instructions described in the tabs below to link an artifact version.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python_sdk"
  values={[
    {label: 'Python SDK', value: 'python_sdk'},
    {label: 'Registry App', value: 'registry_ui'},
    {label: 'Artifact browser', value: 'artifacts_ui'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="python_sdk">


Use the [`link_artifact`](../../ref/python/run.md#link_artifact) method to programmatically link an artifact to a registry. When you link an artifact, specify the path where you want artifact version to link to for the `target_path` parameter. The target path takes the form of `{ORG_ENTITY_NAME}/wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/{COLLECTION_NAME}`. Note that this path informs the registry and collection the artifact will be linked to. 

Replace values enclosed in `<>` with your own:
```python
import wandb

ORG_NAME = "<insert-org-name>"
REGISTRY_NAME = "<insert-registry-name>"  # Set to "model" to link to the model registry
COLLECTION_TYPE = "model"

with wandb.init(project="link-quickstart") as run:
  with open("my_model.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("simulated model file")

  logged_artifact = run.log_artifact("./my_model.txt", "artifact-name", type=COLLECTION_TYPE)
  run.link_artifact(
    artifact=logged_artifact,
    target_path=f"{ORG_NAME}/wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/Example ML Task"
  )
```

If you want to link an artifact version to the **Models** registry or the **Dataset** registry, set the artifact type to `"model"` or `"dataset"`, respectively.

:::tip Linked vs source artifact versions
* Source version: the artifact version inside a team's project that is logged to a [run](../runs/intro.md).
* Linked version: the artifact version that is published to the registry. This is a pointer to the source artifact, and is the exact same artifact version, just made available in the scope of the registry.
