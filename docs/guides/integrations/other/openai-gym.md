# OpenAI Gym

:::info
"The team that has been maintaining Gym since 2021 has moved all future development to [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), a drop in replacement for Gym (import gymnasium as gym), and Gym will not be receiving any future updates."

If you want more control, you can always just manually [log a video](../../track/log/media.md).

The [OpenRL Benchmark](http://wandb.me/openrl-benchmark-report) by[ CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) uses this integration for its OpenAI Gym examples. You can find source code (including [the specific code used for specific runs](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/2jrqfugg/code?workspace=user-costa-huang)) that demonstrates how to use gym with
