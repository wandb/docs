:::info
Support for W&B Prompts ends in 2024. W&B recommends that current Prompt users transition to [Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/?utm_source=wandb_docs&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=weave-nudge), a tool specifically designed for tracking and evaluating LLM applications. Weave offers a faster, more intuitive experience tailored for teams building with Generative AI.

For assistance, contact support@wandb.com. 
:::

This Quickstart guide describes how to use [Trace](./intro.md) to visualize and debug calls to LangChain, LlamaIndex or your own LLM Chain or Pipeline:

1. **[Langchain:](#use-wb-trace-with-langchain)** Use the 1-line LangChain environment variable or context manager integration for automated logging.

2. **[LlamaIndex:](#use-wb-trace-with-llamaindex)** Use the W&B callback from LlamaIndex for automated logging.

3. **[Custom usage](#use-wb-trace-with-any-llm-pipeline-or-plug-in)**: Use Trace with your own custom chains and LLM pipeline code.


## Use W&B Trace with LangChain

:::info
**Versions** Please use `wandb >= 0.15.4` and `langchain >= 0.0.218`
:::

With a 1-line environment variable from LangChain, W&B Trace continuously logs calls to a LangChain Model, Chain, or Agent. 

Note that you can also see the documentation for W&B Trace in the [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/wandb_tracing).

This quickstart uses a LangChain Math Agent:

### 1. Set the LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING environment variable

First, set the LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING environment variable to true. This turns on automated Weights & Biases logging with LangChain:

```python
import os

# turn on wandb logging for langchain
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING"] = "true"
```

Now, W&B logs any call to a LangChain LLM, Chain, Tool, or Agent.

### 2. Configure your Weights & Biases settings
You can optionally set additional Weights & Biases [Environment Variables](/guides/track/environment-variables) to set parameters that are typically passed to `wandb.init()`. Parameters often used include `WANDB_PROJECT` or `WANDB_ENTITY` for more control over where your logs are sent in W&B. For more information about [`wandb.init`](../../../ref/python/init.md), see the API Reference Guide.

```python
# optionally set your wandb settings or configs
os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"] = "langchain-tracing"
```


### 3. Create a LangChain Agent
Create a standard math Agent using LangChain:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=llm)
math_agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)
```


### 4. Run the Agent and start Weights & Biases logging
Use LangChain as normal by calling your Agent. A Weights & Biases run starts and the system prompts you for your Weights & Biases [API key](https:www.wandb.ai/authorize). Once your enter your API key, the Agent streams call inputs and outputs to the Weights & Biases App.

```python
# some sample maths questions
questions = [
    "Find the square root of 5.4.",
    "What is 3 divided by 7.34 raised to the power of pi?",
    "What is the sin of 0.47 radians, divided by the cube root of 27?",
]

for question in questions:
    try:
        # call your Agent as normal
        answer = math_agent.run(question)
        print(answer)
    except Exception as e:
        # any errors will be also logged to Weights & Biases
        print(e)
        pass
```

Once each Agent execution completes, Weights & Biases logs all calls in your LangChain object.


### 5. View the trace in Weights & Biases

Click on the W&B [run](../../runs/intro.md) link generated in the previous step. This  redirects you to your Project workspace in the W&B App. 

Select a run you created to view the trace table, trace timeline and the model architecture of your LLM. 

![](/images/prompts/trace_timeline_detailed.png)


### 6. LangChain Context Manager
Depending on your use case, you might instead prefer to use a context manager to manage your logging to W&B:

```python
from langchain.callbacks import wandb_tracing_enabled

# unset the environment variable and use a context manager instead
if "LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING" in os.environ:
    del os.environ["LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING"]

# enable tracing using a context manager
with wandb_tracing_enabled():
    math_agent.run("What is 5 raised to .123243 power?")  # this should be traced

math_agent.run("What is 2 raised to .123243 power?")  # this should not be traced
```

Please report any issues with this LangChain integration to the [wandb repo](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues) with the tag `langchain`


## Use W&B Trace with Any LLM Pipeline or Plug-In

:::info
**Versions** Please use `wandb >= 0.15.4`
:::

A W&B Trace is created by logging 1 or more "spans". A root span is expected, which can accept nested child spans, which can in turn accept their own child spans. Spans can be of type `AGENT`, `CHAIN`, `TOOL` or `LLM`.

When you log with Trace, a single W&B run can include multiple calls to an LLM, Tool, Chain, or Agent. You don't need to start a new W&B run after each generation from your model or pipeline. Instead, the system appends each call to the Trace table.

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to log a single call to an OpenAI model to W&B Trace as a single span. You'll also learn how to log a more complex series of nested spans.

### 1. Import Trace and start a Weights & Biases run

Call `wandb.init` to start a W&B run. Here you can pass a W&B project name as well as an entity name (if logging to a W&B Team), as well as a config and more. See [`wandb.init`](../../../ref/python/init.md) for the full list of arguments.

When you start a run, W&B prompts you to log in with your API key. You can find your API key on the **[Authorize page](https:wwww.wandb.ai/authorize)**.


```python
import wandb

# start a wandb run to log to
wandb.init(project="trace-example")
```

You can also set the `entity` argument in `wandb.init` if logging to a W&B Team.

### 2. Log to a Trace
Next, you'll query OpenAI and log the results to a W&B Trace. You'll log the inputs and outputs, start, and end times, whether the OpenAI call was successful, token usage, and additional metadata.

You can see the full description of the arguments to the Trace class [here](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/653015a014281f45770aaf43627f64d9c4f04a32/wandb/sdk/data_types/trace_tree.py#L166).

```python
import openai
import datetime
from wandb.sdk.data_types.trace_tree import Trace

openai.api_key = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# define your conifg
model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
temperature = 0.7
system_message = "You are a helpful assistant that always replies in 3 concise bullet points using markdown."

queries_ls = [
    "What is the capital of France?",
    "How do I boil an egg?" * 10000,  # deliberately trigger an openai error
    "What to do if the aliens arrive?",
]

for query in queries_ls:
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": query},
    ]

    start_time_ms = datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model_name, messages=messages, temperature=temperature
        )

        end_time_ms = round(
            datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000
        )  # logged in milliseconds
        status = "success"
        status_message = (None,)
        response_text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        token_usage = response["usage"].to_dict()

    except Exception as e:
        end_time_ms = round(
            datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000
        )  # logged in milliseconds
        status = "error"
        status_message = str(e)
        response_text = ""
        token_usage = {}

    # create a span in wandb
    root_span = Trace(
        name="root_span",
        kind="llm",  # kind can be "llm", "chain", "agent" or "tool"
        status_code=status,
        status_message=status_message,
        metadata={
            "temperature": temperature,
            "token_usage": token_usage,
            "model_name": model_name,
        },
        start_time_ms=start_time_ms,
        end_time_ms=end_time_ms,
        inputs={"system_prompt": system_message, "query": query},
        outputs={"response": response_text},
    )

    # log the span to wandb
    root_span.log(name="openai_trace")
```

### 3. View the trace in Weights & Biases

Click on the W&B [run](../../runs/intro.md) link generated in step 2. Here you should be able to view the trace table and trace timeline of your LLM. 


### 4. Logging a LLM pipeline using nested spans
In this example, you'll simulate an agent making a series of calls: first to an LLM chain, then to an OpenAI LLM, and finally to a calculator tool.

The system logs the inputs, outputs, and metadata for each step in the agents execution in its own span. Spans can also have child spans.

```python
import time

# The query our agent has to answer
query = "How many days until the next US election?"

# part 1 - an Agent is started...
start_time_ms = round(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)

root_span = Trace(
    name="MyAgent",
    kind="agent",
    start_time_ms=start_time_ms,
    metadata={"user": "optimus_12"},
)


# part 2 - The Agent calls into a LLMChain..
chain_span = Trace(name="LLMChain", kind="chain", start_time_ms=start_time_ms)

# add the Chain span as a child of the root
root_span.add_child(chain_span)


# part 3 - the LLMChain calls an OpenAI LLM...
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
    {"role": "user", "content": query},
]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=model_name, messages=messages, temperature=temperature
)

llm_end_time_ms = round(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)
response_text = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
token_usage = response["usage"].to_dict()

llm_span = Trace(
    name="OpenAI",
    kind="llm",
    status_code="success",
    metadata={
        "temperature": temperature,
        "token_usage": token_usage,
        "model_name": model_name,
    },
    start_time_ms=start_time_ms,
    end_time_ms=llm_end_time_ms,
    inputs={"system_prompt": system_message, "query": query},
    outputs={"response": response_text},
)

# add the LLM span as a child of the Chain span...
chain_span.add_child(llm_span)

# update the end time of the Chain span
chain_span.add_inputs_and_outputs(
    inputs={"query": query}, outputs={"response": response_text}
)

# update the Chain span's end time
chain_span._span.end_time_ms = llm_end_time_ms


# part 4 - the Agent then calls a Tool...
time.sleep(3)
days_to_election = 117
tool_end_time_ms = round(datetime.datetime.now().timestamp() * 1000)

# create a Tool span
tool_span = Trace(
    name="Calculator",
    kind="tool",
    status_code="success",
    start_time_ms=llm_end_time_ms,
    end_time_ms=tool_end_time_ms,
    inputs={"input": response_text},
    outputs={"result": days_to_election},
)

# add the TOOL span as a child of the root
root_span.add_child(tool_span)


# part 5 - the final results from the tool are added
root_span.add_inputs_and_outputs(
    inputs={"query": query}, outputs={"result": days_to_election}
)
root_span._span.end_time_ms = tool_end_time_ms


# part 6 - log all spans to W&B by logging the root span
root_span.log(name="openai_trace")
```

Once you have logged your span, your Trace table updates in the W&B App.

## Use W&B Trace with LlamaIndex

:::info
**Versions** Please use `wandb >= 0.15.4` and `llama-index >= 0.6.35`
:::

At the lowest level, LlamaIndex uses the concept of start/end events `CBEventTypes` to keep a track of logs. Each event has some payload which provides information like, the query asked and the response generated by the LLM, or about the number of documents used to create N chunks, etc.

At a higher level, they have recently introduced the concept of Callback Tracing which builds a trace map of connected events. For example when you query over an index, under the hood, retrieval, LLM calls, etc. takes place.

The `WandbCallbackHandler` provides an intuitive way to visualize and track this trace map. It captures the payload of the events and logs them to wandb. It also tracks necessary metadata like total token counts, prompt, context, etc.

Moreover, this callback can also be used to upload and download indices to/from W&B Artifacts for version controlling your indices.

### 1. Import WandbCallbackHandler

First, import the `WandbCallbackHandler` and set it up. You can also pass additional parameters [`wandb.init`](../../../ref/python/init.md) parameters such as your W&B Project or Entity.

You'll see a W&B run start and a prompt for your Weights & Biases **[API key](https:wwww.wandb.ai/authorize)**. Use the generated W&B run link to view your logged LlamaIndex queries and data after you start logging.

```python
from llama_index import ServiceContext
from llama_index.callbacks import CallbackManager, WandbCallbackHandler

# initialise WandbCallbackHandler and pass any wandb.init args
wandb_args = {"project": "llamaindex"}
wandb_callback = WandbCallbackHandler(run_args=wandb_args)

# pass wandb_callback to the service context
callback_manager = CallbackManager([wandb_callback])
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(callback_manager=callback_manager)
```

### 2. Build an Index

You'll build a simple index using a text file.

```python
docs = SimpleDirectoryReader("path_to_dir").load_data()
index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(docs, service_context=service_context)
```

### 3. Query an index and start Weights & Biases logging

With the loaded index, start querying over your documents. Every call to your index is automatically logged to Weights & Biases

```python
questions = [
    "What did the author do growing up?",
    "Did the author travel anywhere?",
    "What does the author love to do?",
]

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

for q in questions:
    response = query_engine.query(q)
```

### 4. View the trace in Weights & Biases

Click on the Weights and Biases run link generated while initializing the `WandbCallbackHandler` in step 1. This takes you to your project workspace in the W&B App where you can view a trace table and  timeline.

![](/images/prompts/llama_index_trace.png)

### 5. Finish tracking

When you are done tracking your LLM queries, it is good practice to close the wandb process like so:

```python
wandb_callback.finish()
```

Thats it! Now you can log your queries to your index using Weights & Biases. If you come across any issues, please file an issue on the [wandb repo](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues) with the tag `llamaindex`

### 6. [Optional] Save your Index data in Weights & Biaes Artifacts
Weights & Biases [Artifacts](../../artifacts/) is a versioned data and model storage product. 

By logging your index to Artifacts and then using it when needed, you can assosciate a particular version of your index with the logged Trace outputs, ensuring full visibility into what data was in your index for a particular call to your index.


```python
#  The string passed to the `index_name` will be your artifact name
wandb_callback.persist_index(index, index_name="my_vector_store")
```

You can then go to the artifacts tab on your W&B run page to view the uploaded index.

**Using an Index stored in W&B Artifacts**

When you load an index from Artifacts you'll return a `StorageContext`. Use this storage context to load the index into memory using a function from the LlamaIndex loading functions.


```python
from llama_index import load_index_from_storage

storage_context = wandb_callback.load_storage_context(
    artifact_url="<entity/project/index_name:version>"
)
index = load_index_from_storagex(storage_context, service_context=service_context)
```

**Note:** for a [`ComposableGraph`](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/v0.9.48/examples/composable_indices/ComposableIndices-Prior.html), you can find the root ID for the index in the artifact's metadata tab in the W&B App.

## Next Steps

- You can use existing W&B features like Tables and Runs to track LLM application performance. See this tutorial to learn more:
