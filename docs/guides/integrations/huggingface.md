# Hugging Face Transformers

<CTAButtons colabLink="https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/huggingface/Optimize_Hugging_Face_models_with_Weights_&_Biases.ipynb"></CTAButtons>

The [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library makes state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and training techniques like mixed precision and gradient checkpointing easy to use. The [W&B integration](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main\_classes/callback.html#transformers.integrations.WandbCallback) adds rich, flexible experiment tracking and model versioning to interactive centralized dashboards without compromising that ease of use.

## ðŸ¤— Next-level logging in few lines

```python
os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"] = "<my-amazing-project>"  # name your W&B project
os.environ["WANDB_LOG_MODEL"] = "checkpoint"  # log all model checkpoints

from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

args = TrainingArguments(..., report_to="wandb")  # turn on W&B logging
trainer = Trainer(..., args=args)
```

## Getting started: track experiments

### 1) Sign Up, install the `wandb` library and log in

a) [**Sign up**](https://wandb.ai/site) for a free account

b) Pip install the `wandb` library

c) To log in in your training script, you'll need to be signed in to you account at www.wandb.ai, then **you will find your API key on the** [**Authorize page**](https://wandb.ai/authorize)**.**

If you are using Weights and Biases for the first time you might want to check out our [**quickstart**](../../quickstart.md)

### 2) Name the project

A [Project](../app/pages/project-page.md) is where all of the charts, data, and models logged from related runs are stored. Naming your project helps you organize your work and keep all the information about a single project in one place.

To add a run to a project simply set the `WANDB_PROJECT` environment variable to the name of your project. The `WandbCallback` will pick up this project name environment variable and use it when setting up your run.

</Tabs>


:::info
Make sure you set the project name _before_ you initialize the `Trainer`.
:::

If a project name is not specified the project name defaults to "huggingface".

### 3) Log your training runs to W&B

This is **the most important step:** when defining your `Trainer` training arguments, either inside your code or from the command line, is to set `report_to` to `"wandb"` in order enable logging with Weights & Biases.

The `logging_steps` argument in `TrainingArguments` will control how often training metrics are pushed to W&B during training. You can also give a name to the training run in W&B using the `run_name` argument. 

That's it! Now your models will log losses, evaluation metrics, model topology, and gradients to Weights & Biases while they train.

)

trainer = Trainer(
    # other args and kwargs here
    args=args,  # your training args
)

trainer.train()  # start training and logging to W&B
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4) Turn on model checkpointing 


Using Weights & Biases' [Artifacts](../artifacts), you can store up to 100GB of models and datasets for free and then use the Weights & Biases [Model Registry](../model_registry) to register models to prepare them for staging or deployment in your production environment.

 Logging your Hugging Face model checkpoints to Artifacts can be done by setting the `WANDB_LOG_MODEL` environment variable to one of `end` or `checkpoint` or `false`: 

-  **`checkpoint`**: a checkpoint will be uploaded every `args.save_steps` from the [`TrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments). 
- **`end`**:  the model will be uploaded at the end of training. 

Use `WANDB_LOG_MODEL` along with `load_best_model_at_end` to upload the best model at the end of training.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  values={[
    {label: 'Python', value: 'python'},
    {label: 'Command Line', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Notebook', value: 'notebook'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="python">

```python
import os

os.environ["WANDB_LOG_MODEL"] = "checkpoint"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">

```bash
WANDB_LOG_MODEL="checkpoint"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notebook">

```notebook
%env WANDB_LOG_MODEL="checkpoint"
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


Any Transformers `Trainer` you initialize from now on will upload models to your W&B project. The model checkpoints you log will be viewable through the [Artifacts](../artifacts) UI, and include the full model lineage (see an example model checkpoint in the UI [here](https://wandb.ai/wandb/arttest/artifacts/model/iv3_trained/5334ab69740f9dda4fed/lineage?_gl=1*yyql5q*_ga*MTQxOTYyNzExOS4xNjg0NDYyNzk1*_ga_JH1SJHJQXJ*MTY5MjMwNzI2Mi4yNjkuMS4xNjkyMzA5NjM2LjM3LjAuMA..). 


:::info
By default, your model will be saved to W&B Artifacts as `model-{run_id}` when `WANDB_LOG_MODEL` is set to `end` or `checkpoint-{run_id}` when `WANDB_LOG_MODEL` is set to `checkpoint`.
However, If you pass a [`run_name`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments.run_name) in your `TrainingArguments`, the model will be saved as `model-{run_name}` or `checkpoint-{run_name}`.
:::

#### W&B Model Registry
Once you have logged your checkpoints to Artifacts, you can then register your best model checkpoints and centralize them across your team using the Weights & Biases **[Model Registry](../model_registry)**. Here you can organize your best models by task, manage model lifecycle, facilitate easy tracking and auditing throughout the ML lifecyle, and [automate](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/models/automation) downstream actions with webhooks or jobs. 

See the [Model Registry](../model_registry) documentation for how to link a model Artifact to the Model Registry.
 
### 5) Visualise evaluation outputs during training

Visualing your model outputs during training or evaluation is often essential to really understand how your model is training.

By using the callbacks system in the Transformers Trainer, you can log additional helpful data to W&B such as your models' text generation outputs or other predictions to W&B Tables. 

See the **[Custom logging section](#custom-logging-log-and-view-evaluation-samples-during-training)** below for a full guide on how to log evaluation outupts while training to log to a W&B Table like this:


![Shows a W&B Table with evaluation outputs](/images/integrations/huggingface_eval_tables.png)

### 6) Finish your W&B Run (Notebook only) 

If your training is encapsulated in a Python script, the W&B run will end when your script finishes.

If you are using a Jupyter or Google Colab notebook, you'll need to tell us when you're done with training by calling `wandb.finish()`.

```python
trainer.train()  # start training and logging to W&B

# post-training analysis, testing, other logged code

wandb.finish()
```

### 7) Visualize your results

Once you have logged your training results you can explore your results dynamically in the [W&B Dashboard](../track/app.md). It's easy to compare across dozens of runs at once, zoom in on interesting findings, and coax insights out of complex data with flexible, interactive visualizations.



## Advanced features and FAQs

### How do I save the best model?
If `load_best_model_at_end=True` is set in the `TrainingArguments` that are passed to the `Trainer`, then W&B will save the best performing model checkpoint to Artifacts.

If you'd like to centralize all your best model versions across your team to organize them by ML task, stage them for production, bookmark them for further evaluation, or kick off downstream Model CI/CD processes then ensure you're saving your model checkpoints to Artifacts. Once logged to Artifacts, these checkpoints can then be promoted to the [Model Registry](../model_registry/intro.md).

### Loading a saved model

If you saved your model to W&B Artifacts with `WANDB_LOG_MODEL`, you can download your model weights for additional training or to run inference. You just load them back into the same Hugging Face architecture that you used before.

```python
# Create a new run
with wandb.init(project="amazon_sentiment_analysis") as run:
    # Pass the name and version of Artifact
    my_model_name = "model-bert-base-high-lr:latest"
    my_model_artifact = run.use_artifact(my_model_name)

    # Download model weights to a folder and return the path
    model_dir = my_model_artifact.download()

    # Load your Hugging Face model from that folder
    #  using the same model class
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        model_dir, num_labels=num_labels
    )

    # Do additional training, or run inference
```

### Resume training from a checkpoint 
If you had set `WANDB_LOG_MODEL='checkpoint'` you can also resume training by you can using the `model_dir` as the `model_name_or_path` argument in your `TrainingArguments` and pass `resume_from_checkpoint=True` to `Trainer`.

```python
last_run_id = "xxxxxxxx"  # fetch the run_id from your wandb workspace

# resume the wandb run from the run_id
with wandb.init(
    project=os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"],
    id=last_run_id,
    resume="must",
) as run:
    # Connect an Artifact to the run
    my_checkpoint_name = f"checkpoint-{last_run_id}:latest"
    my_checkpoint_artifact = run.use_artifact(my_model_name)

    # Download checkpoint to a folder and return the path
    checkpoint_dir = my_checkpoint_artifact.download()

    # reinitialize your model and trainer
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        "<model_name>", num_labels=num_labels
    )
    # your awesome training arguments here.
    training_args = TrainingArguments()

    trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args)

    # make sure use the checkpoint dir to resume training from the checkpoint
    trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=checkpoint_dir)
```

### Custom logging: log and view evaluation samples during training

Logging to Weights & Biases via the Transformers `Trainer` is taken care of by the [`WandbCallback`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main\_classes/callback.html#transformers.integrations.WandbCallback) in the Transformers library. If you need to customize your Hugging Face logging you can modify this callback by subclassing `WandbCallback` and adding additional functionality that leverages additional methods from the Trainer class. 

Below is the general pattern to add this new callback to the HF Trainer, and further down is a code-complete example to log evaluation outputs to a W&B Table:


```python
# Instantiate the Trainer as normal
trainer = Trainer()

# Instantiate the new logging callback, passing it the Trainer object
evals_callback = WandbEvalsCallback(trainer, tokenizer, ...)

# Add the callback to the Trainer
trainer.add_callback(evals_callback)

# Begin Trainer training as normal
trainer.train()
```

#### View evaluation samples during training

The following section shows how to customize the `WandbCallback` to run model predictions and log evaluation samples to a W&B Table during training. We will every `eval_steps` using the `on_evaluate` method of the Trainer callback.

Here, we wrote a `decode_predictions` function to decode the predictions and labels from the model output using the tokenizer.

Then, we create a pandas DataFrame from the predictions and labels and add an `epoch` column to the DataFrame.

Finally, we create a `wandb.Table` from the DataFrame and log it to wandb.
Additionally, we can control the frequency of logging by logging the predictions every `freq` epochs.

**Note**: Unlike the regular `WandbCallback` this custom callback needs to be added to the trainer **after** the `Trainer` is instantiated and not during initialization of the `Trainer`.
This is because the `Trainer` instance is passed to the callback during initialization.

```python
from transformers.integrations import WandbCallback
import pandas as pd


def decode_predictions(tokenizer, predictions):
    labels = tokenizer.batch_decode(predictions.label_ids)
    logits = predictions.predictions.argmax(axis=-1)
    prediction_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(logits)
    return {"labels": labels, "predictions": prediction_text}


class WandbPredictionProgressCallback(WandbCallback):
    """Custom WandbCallback to log model predictions during training.

    This callback logs model predictions and labels to a wandb.Table at each

            records_table = self._wandb.Table(dataframe=predictions_df)

### Additional W&B settings

Further configuration of what is logged with `Trainer` is possible by setting environment variables. A full list of W&B environment variables [can be found here](https://docs.wandb.ai/library/environment-variables).

### Customize `wandb.init`

The `WandbCallback` that `Trainer` uses will call `wandb.init` under the hood when `Trainer` is initialized. You can alternatively set up your runs manually by calling `wandb.init` before the`Trainer` is initialized. This gives you full control over your W&B run configuration.

An example of what you might want to pass to `init` is below. For more details on how to use `wandb.init`, [check out the reference documentation](../../ref/python/init.md).

```python
wandb.init(
    project="amazon_sentiment_analysis",
    name="bert-base-high-lr",
    tags=["baseline", "high-lr"],
    group="bert",
)
```
