# Launch your jobs
Launch jobs directly from within W&B locally on your machine or to the compute provider of your choice. Reproduce runs or sweeps directly from the W&B User Interface to launch new experiments and compare results.


## Recreate a run
Add your W&B Job to a queue to execute a W&B Run. All jobs pushed to a queue automatically posses the same compute resource type and parameter resource arguments. You can alter the hyperparameters to use when you add a job to a queue.

Interactively recreate a W&B Run with the W&B App or programmatically with the CLI.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="app"
  values={[    
    {label: 'W&B App', value: 'app'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="app">
The following procedure demonstrates how to add a job to a queue interactively with the W&B App.

1. Navigate to your project page on the W&B App.
2. Select the **Jobs** tab.

![](/images/launch/project_jobs_tab_gs.png)

3. The **Jobs Page** displays a list of W&B Jobs that were created from previously executed W&B Runs. Find information about the jobs such as the:

> * **Job ID**: Unique Job ID name. For more information about job naming conventions, see [Job naming conventions](create-job#job-naming-conventions).
> * **Versions**: The number of job versions.
> * **Runs**: The number of W&B Runs created by the associated job.
> * **Creation date**: The creation date of the job.
> * **Last run**: The timestamp of the last run created by the job.

4. Select the **Launch** button next to the job name. A UI modal will appear.
5. Within the modal select the:
   
> * Job version you want to add to your queue from the **Job version** dropdown. In this example we only have one version, so we select `v0`. 
> * Select the **Paste fromâ€¦** button to automatically propagate hyperparameters used from a specific W&B Run. In the following image, we have two runs to choose from.

6. From the **Queue** dropdown, select **Starter queue**.  
7. Select the **Launch now** button.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli">
Follow the procedure outlined below to recreate a run with the CLI:

1. Find the name of the run you want to reproduce and its associated job name. See the [View details of each job](#view-details-of-each-job) section for information on how to find the job name.
2. Navigate to your terminal and type the following:

```bash    
wandb launch -j <job-name> -c path/to/config.json
```    
This will default to running on the `Docker runner` on the same machine you intend on running on.

:::info
You need to specify the `run.config` in your config files `overrides.run_config` keys.
:::

The following code snippet demonstrates an example config file:

```json
{
   "overrides": {
      "args": [],
      "run_config": {
	      "lr": <value>,
        "batch_size": <value>
      }
   }
}
```

## Create a sweep
Create W&B Sweeps with Launch. You can create a sweep interactively with the W&B App or programmatically with the W&B CLI.

:::info
Before you create a sweep with W&B Launch, ensure that you create a job first. Inspect that the run you want to create a job from has a code artifact. See the [Create a Job](./create-job.md) page for more information. 
:::


<Tabs
  defaultValue="app"
  values={[
    {label: 'W&B App', value: 'app'},
    {label: 'CLI', value: 'cli'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="app">
Create a sweep interactively with the W&B App.

1. Navigate to you W&B project on the W&B App.  
2. Select the sweeps icon on the left panel (broom image). 
3. Next, select the **Create Sweep** button.
4. Toggle the **Use Launch ðŸš€Â (In Beta)** slider.
5. From the **Job** dropdown menu, select the name of your job and the job version you want to create a sweep from. 
6. Select the queue to add the job to from the **Queue** dropdown menu.
7. Select **Initialize Sweep**.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli">
Programmatically create a W&B Sweep with Launch with the W&B CLI.

1. Create a Sweep configuration
2. Specify the full job name within you sweep configuration
3. Initialize a sweep agent.

:::info
Steps 1 and 3 are the same steps you normally take when you create a W&B Sweep. With the exception that you need to specify the name of the job within your sweep YAML configuration file. 
:::

For example, in the following code snippet, we specify `wandb/launch_demo/job-source-launch_demo-canonical_job_example.py:v0` for the job value:

```yaml
#config.yaml

job: wandb/launch_demo/job-source-launch_demo-canonical_job_example.py:v0
description: sweep examples using launch jobs

method: bayes
metric:
  goal: minimize
  name: ""
parameters:
  learning_rate:
    max: 0.02
    min: 0
    distribution: uniform
  epochs:
    max: 20
    min: 0
    distribution: int_uniform
```

For information on how to create a sweep configuration, see the [Define sweep configuration](../sweeps/define-sweep-configuration.md) page.

4. Next, initialize a sweep. Provide the path to your config file, the name of your job queue, your W&B entity, and the name of the project for the queue, entity, and project flags, respectively.

```bash
wandb sweep <path/to/yaml/file> --queue <queue_name> --entity <your_entity>  --project <project_name>
```

For more information on W&B Sweeps, see the [Tune Hyperparameters](../sweeps/intro.md) chapter.

## View details of launched jobs
View details of launched jobs with the W&B App. You can view job artifacts that were created and find out runs, version and job specific details.

### View job artifacts
Each W&B Job you create is saved as a W&B Artifact. Select the **Artifacts** icon within your projectâ€™s workspace on the W&B App to view a list of job artifacts created in that project.

![](/images/launch/job_artifacts_project_page.png)

Expand the **JOB** menu on the left panel to view a list of job artifacts. For example, in the following image we have two job artifacts called: 
- **job-https___github.com_githubrepo_demo_launch.git_canonical_job_example.py**
- **job-source-launch_demo-canonical_job_example.py**

![](/images/launch/job_artifacts_page.png)

### View details of each job

Navigate to your W&B Project to view fine-grained details of each job such as runs created by a job, the full name of your jobs, and version metadata associated with a project. 

1. Navigate to your W&B project.
2. Select the **Jobs** icon on the left sidebar.
3. A **Jobs** page will appear. In it, you can view all of the jobs created in that project.

![](/images/launch/view_jobs.png)

For example, in the following image we have two job listed:
- **job-https___github.com_githubrepo_demo_launch.git_canonical_job_example.py**
- **job-source-launch_demo-canonical_job_example.py**

Select a job from list to learn more about that job. A new page with a list of runs created by the job, along with job and version details will appear.  This information is contained in three tabs: **Runs**, **Job details**, and **Version details**.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="runs"
  values={[
    {label: 'Runs', value: 'runs'},
    {label: 'Job details', value: 'jobs_details'},
    {label: 'Version details', value: 'version_details'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="runs">

Select the name of your job from the list. This will redirect you to a new page with details about each run created by the job such as the:

The Runs tab provides information about each run created by the job such as the:

- **Run**: The name of the run.
- **State**: The state of the run.
- **Job version**: The version of the job used.
- **Creator**: Who created the run.
- **Creation date**: The timestamp of when the run was started.
- **Other**: The remaining columns will contain the key-value pairs of the configuration dictionary passed to `wandb.init()`. 

For example, in our demo script, we passed the learning rate (`learning_rate`) and number of epochs (`epochs`) when we initialized a run with `wandb.init()`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jobs_details">

The **Job details** provides information about:

* **Description**: An optional description of the job. Select the pencil icon next to this field to add a description.
* **Owner entity**: The entity the job belongs to.
* **Parent project**: The project the job belongs to.
* **Full name**: The full name of your job
* **Creation date**: Creation date of the job.
