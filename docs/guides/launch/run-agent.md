# Start an agent

Start a launch agent to execute jobs from your queues.

## Overview

A **launch agent** is a long-running process that polls on one or more launch queues and executes the jobs that it pops from the queue. A launch agent can be started with the `wandb launch-agent` command and is capable on launching jobs onto a multitude of compute platforms, including Docker, Kubernetes, sagemaker, and more. The launch agent is implemented entirely in our [open source client library](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/tree/main/wandb/sdk/launch).

## How it works

The agent polls on one or more queues. When the launch agent pops an item from a queue, it will, if necessary, build a container image to execute the run within and then execute that container image on the compute platform targeted by the queue.

These container builds and executions happen asynchronously. To control the max number of concurrent jobs that an agent can perform, pass `-j <num-max-jobs>` to `wandb launch-agent` command or set the `max_jobs` field in the agent config file.

### Compile the job into a container image

If your job contains source code from a git repository or code artifact, the launch agent will build a container image that contains the code and all of the dependencies specified in the job.

If your job was sourced from a container image via the `WANDB_DOCKER` environment variable, then this step is skipped.

Launch currently supports building container images with [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko). Kaniko should only be used when running the agent in a container, to avoid the security risks associated with running Docker-in-Docker.

### Execute the run

The launch agent will execute the run in the container image that was built in the previous step or specified in the job. How the agent executes the run depends on the type of queue the job was in.

For example, if the job was in a Docker queue, the agent will execute the run locally with the `docker run` command. If the job was in a Kubernetes queue, the agent will execute the run on a Kubernetes cluster as a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) via the Kubernetes API.

## Agent configuration

The launch agent can be configured with a variety of flags and options. The agent can be configured with a config file or with command line flags. The config file is located at `~/.config/wandb/launch-config.yaml` by default, but the location of the config can be overridden with the `--config` flag. The config file is a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
# W&B entity (i.e. user or team) name
entity: <entity-name>

# Max number of concurrent runs to perform. -1 = no limit
max_jobs: -1

# List of queues to poll.
queues:
  - default

# Cloud environment config.
environment:
  type: aws|gcp|azure

# Container registry config.
registry:
  type: ecr|gcr|acr

# Container build config.
builder:
  type: docker|kaniko|noop
```

The `environment`, `registry`, and `builder` keys are optional. By default, the agent will use no cloud environment, a local Docker registry, and a Docker builder.

### Environments

The `environment` key is used to configure the cloud environment that the agent will need to access in order to do its job. If the agent does not require access to cloud resources, this key should be omitted. See the following references for configuring an AWS or GCP environment.

<Tabs
defaultValue="aws"
values={[
{label: 'AWS', value: 'aws'},
{label: 'GCP', value: 'gcp'},
{label: 'Azure', value: 'azure'}
]}>

<TabItem value="aws">

The AWS environment configuration requires the `region` key to be set. The region should be the AWS region that the agent will be running in. When the agent starts, it will use `boto3` to load the default AWS credentials. See the [boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#overview) for more information on how to configure default AWS credentials.

```yaml
environment:
  type: aws
  region: <aws-region>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gcp">

The GCP environment requires the `region` and `project` keys to be set. The region should be the GCP region that the agent will be running in. The project should be the GCP project that the agent will be running in. When the agent starts, it will use `google.auth.default()` to load the default GCP credentials. See the [google-auth documentation](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/google.auth.html#google.auth.default) for more information on how to configure default GCP credentials.

```yaml
environment:
  type: gcp
  region: <gcp-region>
  project: <gcp-project-id>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure">

The Azure environment does not require any additional keys to be set. When the agent starts, it will use `azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential()` to load the default Azure credentials. See the [azure-identity documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python) for more information on how to configure default Azure credentials.

```yaml
environment:
  type: azure
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Registries

The `registry` key is used to configure the container registry that the agent will use to store container images. If the agent does not require access to a container registry, this key should be omitted.

<Tabs
defaultValue="ecr"
values={[
{label: 'AWS ECR', value: 'ecr'},
{label: 'GCP Artifact Registry', value: 'gcr'},
{label: 'Azure Container Registry', value: 'acr'}
]}>

<TabItem value="ecr">

Set `type: ecr` to use AWS Elastic Container Registry. In order to use `ecr`, must configure an AWS environment. The `repository` key is required and should be the name of the ECR repository that the agent will use to store container images. The agent will use the region configured in the `environment` key to determine which registry to use.

```yaml
registry:
  # Requires an aws environment configuration.
  type: ecr
  # URI of the ECR repository where the agent will store images.
  # Make sure the region matches what you have configured in your
  # environment.
  uri: <account-id>.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>
  # Alternatively, you can simply set the repository name
  # repository: my-repository-name
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gcr">

Set `type: gcr` to use GCP Artifact Registry. In order to use `gcr`, must configure a GCP environment. The `repository` and `image-name` keys are required. The `repository` key should be the name of the Artifact Registry repository that the agent will use to store container images. The agent will use the region and project configured in the `environment` key to determine which registry to use. The `image-name` key should be the name of the image within the repository that the agent will use to store container images.

```yaml
registry:
  # Requires a gcp environment configuration.
  type: gcr
  # URI of the Artifact Registry repository and image name where the agent
  # will store images. Make sure the region and project match what you have
  # configured in your environment.
  uri: <region>-docker.pkg.dev/<project-id>/<repository-name>/<image-name>
  # Alternatively, you may set the repository and image-name keys.
  # repository: my-artifact-repo
  # image-name: my-image-name
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="acr">

Set `type: acr` to use Azure Container Registry. In order to use `acr`, must configure an Azure environment. You must set the `uri` key to the URI of a repository within an Azure Container Registry. The agent will push images to the repository specified in the URI.

```yaml
registry:
  type: acr
  uri: https://my-registry.azurecr.io/my-repository
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Builders

The `builder` key is used to configure the container builder that the agent will use to build container images. The `builder` key is not required and if omitted, the agent will use Docker to build images locally.

<Tabs
defaultValue="docker"
values={[
{label: 'Docker', value: 'docker'},
{label: 'Kaniko', value: 'kaniko'},
{label: 'Noop', value: 'noop'}
]}>

<TabItem value="docker">

Set `type: docker` to use Docker to build images locally. The `docker` builder is selected by default and does not require any additional configuration.

```yaml
builder:
  type: docker
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="kaniko">

Set `type: kaniko` and configure a GCP, AWS, or Azure environment to use Kaniko to build container images in Kubernetes. The `kaniko` builder requires the `build-context-store` key to be set. The `build-context-store` key should be an S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage prefix that the agent will use to store build contexts, depending on the environment that is configured. The `build-job-name` can be used to specify a name prefix for the Kubernetes job that the agent will use to build images.

```yaml
builder:
  type: kaniko
  build-context-store: s3://my-bucket/build-contexts/ # s3, gcs, or azure blob storage uri for build context storage
  build-job-name: wandb-image-build # Kubernetes job name prefix for all builds
```

To specify the `build-context-store` for the `kaniko` builder, you must also configure a cloud environment. The `kaniko` builder supports GCP, AWS, and Azure environments. Please provide the uri in the following formats:

| Cloud | URI                                                       |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| GCP   | `gs://my-bucket/build-contexts/`                          |
| AWS   | `s3://my-bucket/build-contexts/`                          |
| Azure | `https://my-bucket.blob.core.windows.net/build-contexts/` |

To grant Kaniko builds running in Kubernetes access to your blob and container storage in the cloud, it is strongly recommended that you use either [workload identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) if you are using GKE and [IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) if you are using EKS.

You must use [Azure AD Workload Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) to provide the agent credentials if you are using AKS.

If you are running your own Kubernetes cluster rather than using AKS, EKS, or GKE, you will need to create a Kubernetes secret that contains the credentials for your cloud environment. To grant access to GCP, this secret should contain a [service account json](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating). To grant access to AWS, this secret should contain an [AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/guide_credentials_profiles.html). You can configure the Kaniko builder to use this secret by setting the following keys in your builder config:

```yaml
builder:
  type: kaniko
  build-context-store: <my-build-context-store>
  secret-name: <Kubernetes-secret-name>
  secret-key: <secret-file-name>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="noop">

The `noop` builder is useful if you want to limit the agent to running pre-built container images. Simply set `type: noop` to prevent your agent from building images.

```yaml
builder:
  type: noop
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Cloud permissions

The agent requires access to the cloud environment that it is configured to use. The agent will use the credentials configured in the `environment` key to access the cloud environment. The agent will use these credentials to access the cloud environment to push and pull container images, access cloud storage, and trigger on demand compute through cloud services like SageMaker and Vertex AI.

<Tabs
defaultValue="aws"
values={[
{label: 'AWS', value: 'aws'},
{label: 'GCP', value: 'gcp'},
{label: 'Azure', value: 'azure'}
]}>

<TabItem value="aws">

The agent requires credentials to access ECR to push and pull container images if you are using a builder, and acess to an S3 bucket if you want to use the kaniko builder. The following policy can be used to grant the agent access to ECR and S3. The policy should be attached to the IAM role that the agent is running as and the `<PLACEHOLDER>` values should be replaced with the appropriate values for your environment.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ecr:PutLifecyclePolicy",
        "ecr:PutImageTagMutability",
        "ecr:StartImageScan",
        "ecr:CreateRepository",
        "ecr:PutImageScanningConfiguration",
        "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
        "ecr:BatchDeleteImage",
        "ecr:DeleteLifecyclePolicy",
        "ecr:DeleteRepository",
        "ecr:PutImage",
        "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
        "ecr:StartLifecyclePolicyPreview",
        "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
        "ecr:DeleteRepositoryPolicy"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:repository/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:ecr:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>:repository/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "ListObjectsInBucket",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET-NAME>"]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllObjectActions",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*Object",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET-NAME>/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In order to use SageMaker queues, you will also need to create a separate execution role that is assumed by your jobs running in SageMaker. The agent should be granted the following permissions to be allowed to create training jobs:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sagemaker:CreateTrainingJob",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sagemaker:<REGION>:<ACCOUNT-ID>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "<ARN-OF-ROLE-TO-PASS>"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:CreateGrant",
      "Resource": "<ARN-OF-KMS-KEY>",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "kms:ViaService": "sagemaker.<REGION>.amazonaws.com",
          "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

:::note
The `kms:CreateGrant` permission for SageMaker queues is required only if the associated ResourceConfig has a specified VolumeKmsKeyId and the associated role does not have a policy that permits this action.
:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="gcp">

The gcp credentials in the agents environment must include the following permissions in order to access various services:

```yaml
# Permissions for accessing cloud storage. Required for kaniko build.
storage.buckets.get
storage.objects.create
storage.objects.delete
storage.objects.get

# Permissions for accessing artifact registry. Required for any container build.
artifactregistry.dockerimages.list

# Permissions for listing accessible compute regions. Required always.
compute.regions.get

# Permissions for managing Vertex AI jobs. Required for Vertex queues.
ml.jobs.create
ml.jobs.list
ml.jobs.get
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="azure">

The agent requires the following roles be assigned to its service principal in order to access various services:

- **Storage Blob Data Contributor**: Required for kaniko build ([docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor))
- **AcrPush**: Required for kaniko build ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-roles#acrpush))

These permissions should be scoped to any storage containers and containers registries that you plan to access with the agent.
