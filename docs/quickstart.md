# Quickstart
This guide outlines a common method for integrating W&B into your code. There are for main steps:
1. [Set up W&B](#set-up-wb)
2. [Track metrics](#track-metrics)
3. [Track hyperparameters](#track-hyperparameters)
4. [Get an alert](#get-alerts)

## Set up W&B
Satisfy the following requirements to get started with W&B:  

1.  [Sign up](https://wandb.ai/site) for a free account at [https://wandb.ai/site](https://wandb.ai/site) and then login to your wandb account.  
2. Install the wandb library on your machine in a Python 3 environment using `pip`.  
3. Login to the wandb library on your machine. You will find your API key here: [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).  

The following code snippets demonstrate how to install and log into W&B using the W&B CLI and Python Library:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="cli"
  values={[
    {label: 'Command Line', value: 'cli'},
    {label: 'Notebook', value: 'notebook'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="cli">

Install the CLI and Python library for interacting with the Weights and Biases API:

```
pip install wandb
```

Next, log in to W&B:

```
wandb login
```

Or if you're using [W&B Server:](./guides/hosting/intro.md)

```
wandb login --host=http://wandb.your-shared-local-host.com
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="notebook">

Install the CLI and Python library for interacting with the Weights and Biases API:

```python
!pip install wandb
```

Next, import the W&B Python SDK and log in:

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Start a new Run

Initialize a new Run in W&B in your Python script or notebook with [`wandb.init()`](./ref/python/run.md). At the top of your training script add the following code snippet:

```python
import wandb
wandb.init(project="my-awesome-project")
```
W&B tracks system metrics and console logs when you call the `wandb.init()` API. 

Run your code and put in [your API key](https://wandb.ai/authorize) when prompted. In the next step, we will show you how to track metrics. 


## Track metrics

Use [`wandb.log()`](./ref/python/log.md) to track metrics or a framework [integration](guides/integrations/intro.md) for easy instrumentation.

```python
wandb.log({'accuracy': train_acc, 'loss': train_loss})
```

W&B saves metrics you log with `wandb.log` to the Run object you initialized. In this case, the accuracy and loss are associated with the W&B Run we initialized in the previous step.

## Track hyperparameters

Save hyperparameters with [`wandb.config`](./guides/track/config.md). Tracking hyperparameters makes it easy to compare experiments with the W&B App. 

```python
wandb.config.dropout = 0.2
```
Attributes stored in a `wandb.config` object are associated with the most recent initialized Run object.

## Get alerts

Get notified by Slack or email if your W&B Run has crashed or with a custom trigger. For example, you can create a trigger to notify you if your loss reports `NaN` or a step in your ML pipeline has completed.

Follow the procedure outlined below to set up an alert: 

1. Turn on Alerts in your W&B [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings).
2. Add [`wandb.alert()`](./guides/runs/alert.md) to your code.

```python
wandb.alert(
    title="Low accuracy", 
    text=f"Accuracy {acc} is below threshold {thresh}"
)
```
You will receive an email or Slack alert when your alert criteria is met. For example, the proceeding image demonstrates a Slack alert:

See the [Alerts docs](./guides/runs/alert.md) for more information on how to set up an alert. For more information about setting options, see the [Settings](./guides/app/settings-page/intro.md) page.

## Common Questions

**Where do I find my API key?**
Once you've signed in to www.wandb.ai, the API key will be on the [Authorize page](https://wandb.ai/authorize).

**How do I use W&B in an automated environment?**
If you are training models in an automated environment where it's inconvenient to run shell commands, such as Google's CloudML, you should look at our guide to configuration with [Environment Variables](guides/track/environment-variables.md).

**Do you offer local, on-prem installs?**
Yes, you can [privately host W&B](guides/hosting/intro.md) locally on your own machines or in a private cloud, try [this quick tutorial notebook](http://wandb.me/intro) to see how. Note, to login to wandb local server you can [set the host flag](./guides/hosting/basic-setup.md#login) to the address of the local instance.  **** 

**How do I turn off wandb logging temporarily?**
If you're testing code and want to disable wandb syncing, set the environment variable [`WANDB_MODE=offline`](guides/track/environment-variables.md).
