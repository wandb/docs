Flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning.

```python
Artifact(
    name: str,
    type: str,
    description: Optional[str] = None,
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    incremental: bool = (False),
    use_as: Optional[str] = None
) -> None
```

Construct an empty W&B Artifact. Populate an artifacts contents with methods that
begin with `add`. Once the artifact has all the desired files, you can call
`wandb.log_artifact()` to log it.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `name` |  A human-readable name for the artifact. Use the name to identify a specific artifact in the W&B App UI or programmatically. You can interactively reference an artifact with the `use_artifact` Public API. A name can contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. The name must be unique across a project. |
|  `type` |  The artifact's type. Use the type of an artifact to both organize and differentiate artifacts. You can use any string that contains letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. Common types include `dataset` or `model`. Include `model` within your type string if you want to link the artifact to the W&B Model Registry. |
|  `description` |  A description of the artifact. For Model or Dataset Artifacts, add documentation for your standardized team model or dataset card. View an artifact's description programmatically with the `Artifact.description` attribute or programmatically with the W&B App UI. W&B renders the description as markdown in the W&B App. |
|  `metadata` |  Additional information about an artifact. Specify metadata as a dictionary of key-value pairs. You can specify no more than 100 total keys. |

| Returns |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  An `Artifact` object. |

| Attributes |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `aliases` |  List of one or more semantically-friendly references or identifying "nicknames" assigned to an artifact version. Aliases are mutable references that you can programmatically reference. Change an artifact's alias with the W&B App UI or programmatically. See [Create new artifact versions](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/create-a-new-artifact-version) for more information. |
|  `collection` |  The collection this artifact was retrieved from. A collection is an ordered group of artifact versions. If this artifact was retrieved from a portfolio / linked collection, that collection will be returned rather than the collection that an artifact version originated from. The collection that an artifact originates from is known as the source sequence. |
|  `commit_hash` |  The hash returned when this artifact was committed. |
|  `created_at` |  Timestamp when the artifact was created. |
|  `description` |  A description of the artifact. |
|  `digest` |  The logical digest of the artifact. The digest is the checksum of the artifact's contents. If an artifact has the same digest as the current `latest` version, then `log_artifact` is a no-op. |
|  `entity` |  The name of the entity of the secondary (portfolio) artifact collection. |
|  `file_count` |  The number of files (including references). |
|  `id` |  The artifact's ID. |
|  `manifest` |  The artifact's manifest. The manifest lists all of its contents, and can't be changed once the artifact has been logged. |
|  `metadata` |  User-defined artifact metadata. Structured data associated with the artifact. |
|  `name` |  The artifact name and version in its secondary (portfolio) collection. A string with the format {collection}:{alias}. Before the artifact is saved, contains only the name since the version is not yet known. |
|  `project` |  The name of the project of the secondary (portfolio) artifact collection. |
|  `qualified_name` |  The entity/project/name of the secondary (portfolio) collection. |
|  `size` |  The total size of the artifact in bytes. Includes any references tracked by this artifact. |
|  `source_collection` |  The artifact's primary (sequence) collection. |
|  `source_entity` |  The name of the entity of the primary (sequence) artifact collection. |
|  `source_name` |  The artifact name and version in its primary (sequence) collection. A string with the format {collection}:{alias}. Before the artifact is saved, contains only the name since the version is not yet known. |
|  `source_project` |  The name of the project of the primary (sequence) artifact collection. |
|  `source_qualified_name` |  The entity/project/name of the primary (sequence) collection. |
|  `source_version` |  The artifact's version in its primary (sequence) collection. A string with the format "v{number}". |
|  `state` |  The status of the artifact. One of: "PENDING", "COMMITTED", or "DELETED". |
|  `ttl` |  The time-to-live (TTL) policy of an artifact. Artifacts are deleted shortly after a TTL policy's duration passes. If set to `None`, the artifact deactivates TTL policies and will be not scheduled for deletion, even if there is a team default TTL. An artifact inherits a TTL policy from the team default if the team administrator defines a default TTL and there is no custom policy set on an artifact. |
|  `type` |  The artifact's type. Common types include `dataset` or `model`. |
|  `updated_at` |  The time when the artifact was last updated. |
|  `version` |  The artifact's version in its secondary (portfolio) collection. |

## Methods

### `add_reference`

[View source](https://www.github.com/wandb/wandb/tree/v0.17.9/wandb/sdk/artifacts/artifact.py#L1266-L1347)

```python
add_reference(
    uri: Union[ArtifactManifestEntry, str],
    name: Optional[StrPath] = None,
    checksum: bool = (True),
    max_objects: Optional[int] = None
) -> Sequence[ArtifactManifestEntry]
```

Add a reference denoted by a URI to the artifact.

Unlike files or directories that you add to an artifact, references are not
uploaded to W&B. For more information,
see [Track external files](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/track-external-files).

By default, the following schemes are supported:

- http(s): The size and digest of the file will be inferred by the
  `Content-Length` and the `ETag` response headers returned by the server.
- s3: The checksum and size are pulled from the object metadata. If bucket
  versioning is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked.
- gs: The checksum and size are pulled from the object metadata. If bucket
  versioning is enabled, then the version ID is also tracked.
- https, domain matching `*.blob.core.windows.net` (Azure): The checksum and size
  are be pulled from the blob metadata. If storage account versioning is
  enabled, then the version ID is also tracked.
- file: The checksum and size are pulled from the file system. This scheme
  is useful if you have an NFS share or other externally mounted volume
  containing files you wish to track but not necessarily upload.

For any other scheme, the digest is just a hash of the URI and the size is left
blank.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `uri` |  The URI path of the reference to add. The URI path can be an object returned from `Artifact.get_entry` to store a reference to another artifact's entry. |
|  `name` |  The path within the artifact to place the contents of this reference. |
|  `checksum` |  Whether or not to checksum the resource(s) located at the reference URI. Checksumming is strongly recommended as it enables automatic integrity validation. Disabling checksumming will speed up artifact creation but reference directories will not iterated through so the objects in the directory will not be saved to the artifact. We recommend setting `checksum=False` when adding reference objects, in which case a new version will only be created if the reference URI changes. |
|  `max_objects` |  The maximum number of objects to consider when adding a reference that points to directory or bucket store prefix. By default, the maximum number of objects allowed for Amazon S3, GCS, Azure, and local files is 10,000,000. Other URI schemas do not have a maximum. |

| Returns |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  The added manifest entries. |

| Raises |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `ArtifactFinalizedError` |  You cannot make changes to the current artifact version because it is finalized. Log a new artifact version instead. |

source artifact is unaffected.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |

    skip_cache: Optional[bool] = None,
    path_prefix: Optional[StrPath] = None
) -> FilePathStr
```

Existing files located within `root` are not modified. Explicitly delete `root`
before you call `download` if you want the contents of `root` to exactly match
the artifact.

| Arguments |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `root` |  The directory W&B stores the artifact's files. |
|  `allow_missing_references` |  If set to `True`, any invalid reference paths will be ignored while downloading referenced files. |

|  `path_prefix` |  If specified, only files with a path that starts with the given prefix will be downloaded. Uses unix format (forward slashes). |

| Returns |  |
| :--- | :--- |
