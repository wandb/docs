Media object for trace tree data.

```python
WBTraceTree(
    root_span: Span,
    model_dict: typing.Optional[dict] = None
)
```

| Args |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `root_span` (`Span`): The root span of the trace tree.|
| `model_dict` (`dict`, optional): A dictionary containing the model dump. `model_dict` is a completely user-defined `dict`. The UI will render a JSON viewer for this `dict`, giving special treatment to dictionaries with a `_kind` key. This is because model vendors have such different serialization formats that we need to be flexible here. |
