# Fixes

We're releasing a couple of important fixes for the _**Custom Roles**_ preview capability that was launched as part of v0.47.2. If you're interested in using that feature to create fine-grained roles and better align with least privilege principle, please use this latest server release and reach out to your Weights & Biases team for an updated enterprise license.
