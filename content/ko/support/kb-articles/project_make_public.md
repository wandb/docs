To make a project public, follow these steps:

1. Access the project page in the W&B web app.
2. Click the lock icon in the navigation bar to open privacy settings.
3. Choose "Public" to allow visibility for anyone.
4. Save the changes.

If the "Public" option is not available due to restrictions, consider the following options:

- Share a view-only link via a report.
- Contact the organization's admin for assistance.
- Check account settings to confirm permission for public projects.
