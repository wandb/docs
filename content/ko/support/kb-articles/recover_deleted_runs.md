To recover deleted runs, complete the following steps:

- Navigate to the Project Overview page.
- Click the three dots in the top right corner.
- Select **Undelete recently deleted runs**.

**Notes**:
- You can only restore runs deleted within the last 7 days.
- You can manually upload logs using the W&B API if undelete is not an option.
