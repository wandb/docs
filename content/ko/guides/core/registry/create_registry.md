## Visibility types

The *visibility* of a registry determines who can access that registry. Restricting the visibility of a custom registry helps ensure that only specified members can access that registry.

There are two type registry visibility options for a custom registry: 

| Visibility | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| Restricted   | Only invited organization members can access the registry.| 
| Organization | Everyone in the org can access the registry. |

A team administrator or registry administrator can set the visibility of a custom registry.

The user who creates a custom registry with Restricted visibility is added to the registry automatically as its registry admin. 


## Configure the visibility of a custom registry

A team administrator or registry administrator can assign the visibility of a custom registry during or after the creation of a custom registry. 

To restrict the visibility of an existing custom registry:

1. Navigate to the **Registry** App at https://wandb.ai/registry/.
2. Select a registry.
3. Click on the gear icon on the upper right hand corner.
4. From the **Registry visibility** dropdown, select the desired registry visibility.
5. if you select **Restricted visibility**:
   1. Add members of your organization that you want to have access to this registry. Scroll to the **Registry members and roles** section and click on the **Add member** button. 
   2. Within the **Member** field, add the email or username of the member you want to add.
   3. Click **Add new member**.
