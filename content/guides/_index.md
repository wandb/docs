## What is W&B?

Weights & Biases (W&B) is the AI developer platform, with tools for training models, fine-tuning models, and leveraging foundation models. 

{{< img src="/images/general/architecture.png" alt="" >}}

W&B consists of three major components: [Models]({{< relref "/guides/models.md" >}}), [Weave](https://wandb.github.io/weave/), and [Core]({{< relref "/guides/core/" >}}):

**[W&B Models]({{< relref "/guides/models/" >}})** is a set of lightweight, interoperable tools for machine learning practitioners training and fine-tuning models.
- [Experiments]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/" >}}): Machine learning experiment tracking
- [Sweeps]({{< relref "/guides/models/sweeps/" >}}): Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization
- [Registry]({{< relref "/guides/models/registry/" >}}): Publish and share your ML models and datasets

**[W&B Weave]({{< relref "/guides/weave/" >}})** is a lightweight toolkit for tracking and evaluating LLM applications.

**[W&B Core]({{< relref "/guides/core/" >}})** is set of powerful building blocks for tracking and visualizing data and models, and communicating results.
- [Artifacts]({{< relref "/guides/core/artifacts/" >}}): Version assets and track lineage
- [Tables]({{< relref "/guides/core/tables/" >}}): Visualize and query tabular data
- [Reports]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports/" >}}): Document and collaborate on your discoveries

## How does W&B work?

Read the following sections in this order if you are a first-time user of W&B and you are interested in training, tracking, and visualizing machine learning models and experiments:

1. Learn about [runs]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/runs/" >}}), W&B's basic unit of computation.
2. Create and track machine learning experiments with [Experiments]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/" >}}).
3. Discover W&B's flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning with [Artifacts]({{< relref "/guides/core/artifacts/" >}}).
4. Automate hyperparameter search and explore the space of possible models with [Sweeps]({{< relref "/guides/models/sweeps/" >}}).
5. Manage the model lifecycle from training to production with [Registry]({{< relref "/guides/models/registry/" >}}).
6. Visualize predictions across model versions with our [Data Visualization]({{< relref "/guides/core/tables/" >}}) guide.
7. Organize runs, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, and share updates with collaborators with [Reports]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports/" >}}).
