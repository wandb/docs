W&B Core is the foundational framework supporting [W&B Models](./models/) and [W&B Weave](./weave_platform/), and is itself supported by the [W&B Platform](./hosting/).

W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML](./artifacts/) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations](./tables/).
- [Document and share](./reports/) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data](../guides/app/features/panels/query-panel/) that serve your custom needs.
