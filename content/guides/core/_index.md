W&B Core is the foundational framework supporting [W&B Models](./models.md) and [W&B Weave](./weave_platform.md), and is itself supported by the [W&B Platform](./hosting/_index.md).

W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML](./artifacts/_index.md) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations](./tables/_index.md).
- [Document and share](./reports/_index_.md) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data](../guides/app/features/panels/query-panel/_index.md) that serve your custom needs.
