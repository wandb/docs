W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML]({{< relref "./artifacts/" >}}) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- [Document and share]({{< relref "./reports/" >}}) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data]({{< relref "/guides/models/app/features/panels/query-panels/" >}}) that serve your custom needs.
