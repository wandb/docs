W&B Core is the foundational framework supporting [W&B Models]({{< relref "/guides/models/" >}}) and [W&B Weave]({{< relref "/guides/weave/" >}}), and is itself supported by the [W&B Platform]({{< relref "/guides/hosting/" >}}).

W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML]({{< relref "/guides/core/artifacts/" >}}) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations]({{< relref "/guides/models/tables/" >}}).
- [Document and share]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports/" >}}) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data]({{< relref "/guides/models/app/features/panels/query-panels/" >}}) that serve your custom needs.
- Configure custom automations that trigger key workflows for [model CI/CD]({{< relref "/guides/core/automations/model-registry-automations.md" >}}).
