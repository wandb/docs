Support for W&B Prompts will end in 2024. W&B recommends that current Prompt users transition to [Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/?utm_source=wandb_docs&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=weave-nudge), a tool specifically designed for tracking and evaluating LLM applications. Weave offers a faster, more intuitive experience tailored for teams building with Generative AI.

For assistance, contact support@wandb.com.

W&B has 2 OpenAI integrations to help you train better models faster and keep track of your prompts and generations:

## OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4 fine-tuning
With W&Bs you can log your OpenAI model's fine-tuning metrics and configuration to W&Bs to analyse and understand the performance of your newly fine-tuned models and share the results with your colleagues.

See the [W&B and OpenAI Fine-Tuning docs here](../other/openai-api.md) to learn more

## OpenAI Python SDK API
Log requests, responses, token counts and model metadata with 1 line of code for all OpenAI models
