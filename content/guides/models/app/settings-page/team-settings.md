## Members
The Members section shows a list of all pending invitations and the members that have either accepted the invitation to join the team. Each member listed displays a member’s name, username, email, team role, as well as their access privileges to Models and Weave, which is inherited by from the Organization. There are three standard team roles: Administrator (Admin), Member, and View-only.

See [Add and Manage teams](../../hosting/iam/manage-organization.md#add-and-manage-teams) for information on how to create a tea, invite users to a team, remove users from a team, and change a user's role.

## Avatar

Set an avatar by navigating to the **Avatar** section and uploading an image.
