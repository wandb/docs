### Usage alerts

{{% alert %}}
Usage alerts are not available on the [Enterprise plan](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing/).
{{% /alert %}}

For organizations on paid plans, admins receive alerts via email **once per billing period** when certain thresholds are met, along with details about how to increase your organization's limits if you are a [billing admin]({{< relref "#billing-admin" >}}) and how to contact a billing admin otherwise. On the [Pro plan](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing/), only the billing admin receives usage alerts.

These alerts are not configurable, and are sent when:

- Your organization is approaching a monthly limit of a category of usage (85% of hours used) and when it reaches 100% of the limit, according to your plan.
- Your organization's accumulated average charges for a billing period exceed these thresholds: $200, $450, $700, and $1000. These overage charges are incurred when your organization accumulates more usage than your plan includes for tracked hours, storage, or Weave data ingestion.

For questions about usage or billing, contact your account team or Support.

## Payment methods
This section shows the payment methods on file for your organization. If you have not added a payment method, you will be prompted to do so when you upgrade your plan or add paid storage.
