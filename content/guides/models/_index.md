W&B Models is the system of record for ML Practitioners who want to organize their models, boost productivity and collaboration, and deliver production ML at scale. 

{{< img src="/images/general/architecture.png" alt="" >}}

With W&B Models, you can: 

- Track and visualize all [ML experiments](./track/intro/).
- Optimize and fine-tune models at scale with [hyperparameter sweeps](./sweeps/intro/).
- [Maintain a centralized hub of all models](./model_registry/intro/), with a seamless handoff point to devops and deployment
- Configure custom automations that trigger key workflows for [model CI/CD](./model_registry/model-registry-automations/).



Machine learning practitioners rely on W&B Models as their ML system of record to track and visualize experiments, manage model versions and lineage, and optimize hyperparameters.
