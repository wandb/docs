{{% alert %}}
W&B Registry is now in public preview. Visit [this]({{< relref "#enable-wb-registry" >}}) section to learn how to enable it for your deployment type.
{{% /alert %}}


W&B Registry is a curated central repository of [artifact]({{< relref "/guides/core/artifacts/" >}}) versions within your organization. Users who [have permission]({{< relref "./configure_registry.md" >}}) within your organization can [download]({{< relref "./download_use_artifact.md" >}}), share, and collaboratively manage the lifecycle of all artifacts, regardless of the team that user belongs to.

You can use the Registry to [track artifact versions]({{< relref "./link_version.md" >}}), audit the history of an artifact's usage and changes, ensure governance and compliance of your artifacts, and [automate downstream processes such as model CI/CD]({{< relref "../automations/" >}}).

In summary, use W&B Registry to:

- [Promote]({{< relref "./link_version.md" >}}) artifact versions that satisfy a machine learning task to other users in your organization.
- Organize [artifacts with tags]({{< relref "./organize-with-tags.md" >}}) so that you can find or reference specific artifacts.
- Track an [artifact’s lineage]({{< relref "/guides/models/registry/model_registry/model-lineage.md" >}}) and audit the history of changes.
- [Automate]({{< relref "/guides/models/automations/model-registry-automations.md" >}}) downstream processes such as model CI/CD.
- [Limit who in your organization]({{< relref "./configure_registry.md" >}}) can access artifacts in each registry.

<!-- - Quickly find or reference important artifacts with a unique identifier known as aliases.-->

The preceding image shows the Registry App with "Model" and "Dataset" core registries along with custom registries.


## Learn the basics
Each organization initially contains two registries that you can use to organize your model and dataset artifacts called **Models** and **Datasets**, respectively. You can create [additional registries to organize other artifact types based on your organization's needs]({{< relref "./registry_types.md" >}}). 

Each [registry]({{< relref "./configure_registry.md" >}}) consists of one or more [collections]({{< relref "./create_collection.md" >}}). Each collection represents a distinct task or use case.

{{< img src="/images/registry/homepage_registry.png" >}}

To add an artifact to a registry, you first log a [specific artifact version to W&B]({{< relref "/guides/core/artifacts/create-a-new-artifact-version.md" >}}). Each time you log an artifact, W&B automatically assigns a version to that artifact. Artifact versions use 0 indexing, so the first version is `v0`, the second version is `v1`, and so on. 

Once you log an artifact to W&B, you can then link that specific artifact version to a collection in the registry. 

{{% alert %}}
The term "link" refers to pointers that connect where W&B stores the artifact and where the artifact is accessible in the registry. W&B does not duplicate artifacts when you link an artifact to a collection.
{{% /alert %}}

As an example, the proceeding code example shows how to log and link a fake model artifact called "my_model.txt" to a collection named "first-collection" in the [core Model registry]({{< relref "./registry_types.md" >}}). More specifically, the code accomplishes the following:

1. Initialize a W&B run.
2. Log the artifact to W&B.
3. Specify the name of the collection and registry you want to link your artifact version to.
4. Link the artifact to the collection.

Copy and paste the proceeding code snippet into a Python script and run it. Ensure that you have W&B Python SDK version 0.18.6 or greater.

```python title="hello_collection.py"
import wandb
import random

# Initialize a W&B run to track the artifact
run = wandb.init(project="registry_quickstart") 

# Create a simulated model file so that you can log it
with open("my_model.txt", "w") as f:
   f.write("Model: " + str(random.random()))

# Log the artifact to W&B
logged_artifact = run.log_artifact(
    artifact_or_path="./my_model.txt", 
    name="gemma-finetuned", 
    type="model" # Specifies artifact type
)

# Specify the name of the collection and registry
# you want to publish the artifact to
COLLECTION_NAME = "first-collection"
REGISTRY_NAME = "model"

# Link the artifact to the registry
run.link_artifact(
    artifact=logged_artifact, 
    target_path=f"wandb-registry-{REGISTRY_NAME}/{COLLECTION_NAME}"
)
```

W&B automatically creates a collection for you if the collection you specify in the returned run object's `link_artifact(target_path = "")` method does not exist within the registry you specify.

The URL that your terminal prints directs you to the project where W&B stores your artifact.

Navigate to the Registry App to view artifact versions that you and other members of your organization publish. To do so, first navigate to W&B. Select **Registry** in the left sidebar below **Applications**. Select the "Model" registry. Within the registry, you should see the "first-collection" collection with your linked artifact version.

Once you link an artifact version to a collection within a registry, members of your organization can view, download, and manage your artifact versions, create downstream automations, and more if they have the proper permissions. 

## Enable W&B Registry

Based on your deployment type, satisfy the following conditions to enable W&B Registry:

| Deployment type | How to enable |
| ----- | ----- |
| Multi-tenant Cloud | No action required. W&B Registry is available on the W&B App. |
| Dedicated Cloud | Contact your account team. The Solutions Architect (SA) Team enables W&B Registry within your instance's operator console. Ensure your instance is on server release version 0.59.2 or newer.|
| Self-Managed   | Enable the environment variable called `ENABLE_REGISTRY_UI`. To learn more about enabling environment variables in server, visit [these docs]({{< relref "/guides/hosting/env-vars/" >}}). In self-managed instances, your infrastructure administrator should enable this environment variable and set it to `true`. Ensure your instance is on server release version 0.59.2 or newer.|


## Resources to get started

Depending on your use case, explore the following resources to get started with the W&B Registry:

* Check out the tutorial video:
    * [Getting started with Registry from Weights & Biases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4XkVOsjIeM)
* Take the W&B [Model CI/CD](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/enterprise-model-management) course and learn how to:
    * Use W&B Registry to manage and version your artifacts, track lineage, and promote models through different lifecycle stages.
    * Automate your model management workflows using webhooks.
    * Integrate the registry with external ML systems and tools for model evaluation, monitoring, and deployment.



## Migrate from the legacy Model Registry to W&B Registry

The legacy Model Registry is scheduled for deprecation with the exact date not yet decided. Before deprecating the legacy Model Registry, W&B will migrate the contents of the legacy Model Registry to the W&B Registry. 


See [Migrating from legacy Model Registry]({{< relref "./model_registry_eol.md" >}}) for more information about the migration process from the legacy Model Registry to W&B Registry.

Until the migration occurs, W&B supports both the legacy Model Registry and the new Registry. 

{{% alert %}}
To view the legacy Model Registry, navigate to the Model Registry in the W&B App. A banner appears at the top of the page that enables you to use the legacy Model Registry App UI.

{{< img src="/images/registry/nav_to_old_model_reg.gif" alt="" >}}
{{% /alert %}}


Reach out to support@wandb.com with any questions or to speak to the W&B Product Team about any concerns about the migration.
