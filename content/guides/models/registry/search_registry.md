As you add more artifacts to the W&B Registry App, you may need to search for a specific registry, collection, artifact version tag, or collection tag. You can click through the W&B Registry App to find a specific collection, registry, artifact version, or collection tag. However, this method can be time-consuming as the number of artifacts in your organization increases. 

Instead of manually clicking through a registry or collection, you can use the global search bar to quickly find a specific registry, collection, artifact version tag, or collection tag. To search globally:

1. Navigate to the W&B Registry App at https://wandb.ai/registry/. 
2. Enter the search term in the search bar at the top of the page. 

Search results appear below the search bar if the term you specify matches an existing registry, collection, artifact version tag, or collection tag.

Only registries, collections, artifact version tags, and collection tags that you have permission to view appear in the search results.
