You can browse the W&B Registry App interactively to find a specific collection, registry, artifact version, or collection tag. However, this method can be time-consuming when a registry has a large number of items.

Use the global search bar to quickly find a specific registry, collection, artifact version tag, or collection tag efficiently. To search globally:

1. Navigate to the W&B Registry App at https://wandb.ai/registry/. 
2. Enter the search term in the search bar at the top of the page. 

Search results appear below the search bar if the term you specify matches an existing registry, collection, artifact version tag, or collection tag.

Only items that you have permission to view appear in the search results.
