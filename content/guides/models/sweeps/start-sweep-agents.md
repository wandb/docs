Start a W&B Sweep on one or more agents on one or more machines. W&B Sweep agents query the W&B server you launched when you initialized a W&B Sweep (`wandb sweep)` for hyperparameters and use them to run model training.

To start a W&B Sweep agent, provide the W&B Sweep ID that was returned when you initialized a W&B Sweep. The W&B Sweep ID has the form:

```bash
entity/project/sweep_ID
```

Where:

* entity: Your W&B username or team name.
* project: The name of the project where you want the output of the W&B Run to be stored. If the project is not specified, the run is put in an "Uncategorized" project.
* sweep_ID: The pseudo random, unique ID generated by W&B.

Provide the name of the function the W&B Sweep will execute if you start a W&B Sweep agent within a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

The proceeding code snippets demonstrate how to start an agent with W&B. We assume you already have a configuration file and you have already initialized a W&B Sweep. For more information about how to define a configuration file, see [Define sweep configuration]({{< relref "./define-sweep-configuration.md" >}}).

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
{{% tab header="CLI" %}}
Use the `wandb agent` command to start a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that was returned when you initialized the sweep. Copy and paste the code snippet below and replace `sweep_id` with your sweep ID:

```bash
wandb agent sweep_id
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab header="Python script or notebook" %}}
Use the W&B Python SDK library to start a sweep. Provide the sweep ID that was returned when you initialized the sweep. In addition, provide the name of the function  the sweep will execute.

```python
wandb.agent(sweep_id=sweep_id, function=function_name)
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabpane >}}



### Stop W&B agent

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}
Random and Bayesian searches will run forever. You must stop the process from the command line, within your python script, or the [Sweeps UI]({{< relref "./visualize-sweep-results.md" >}}).
{{% /alert %}}

Optionally specify the number of W&B Runs a Sweep agent should try. The following code snippets demonstrate how to set a maximum number of [W&B Runs]({{< relref "/ref/python/run.md" >}}) with the CLI and within a Jupyter Notebook, Python script.

{{< tabpane text=true >}}
  {{% tab header="Python script or notebook" %}}
First, initialize your sweep. For more information, see [Initialize sweeps]({{< relref "./initialize-sweeps.md" >}}).

```
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config)
```

Next, start the sweep job. Provide the sweep ID generated from sweep initiation. Pass an integer value to the count parameter to set the maximum number of runs to try.

```python
sweep_id, count = "dtzl1o7u", 10
wandb.agent(sweep_id, count=count)
```

{{% alert color="secondary" %}}
If you start a new run after the sweep agent has finished, within the same script or notebook, then you should call `wandb.teardown()` before starting the new run.
{{% /alert %}}  
  {{% /tab %}}
  {{% tab header="CLI" %}}
First, initialize your sweep with the [`wandb sweep`]({{< relref "/ref/cli/wandb-sweep.md" >}}) command. For more information, see [Initialize sweeps]({{< relref "./initialize-sweeps.md" >}}).

```
wandb sweep config.yaml
```

Pass an integer value to the count flag to set the maximum number of runs to try.

```python
NUM=10
SWEEPID="dtzl1o7u"
wandb agent --count $NUM $SWEEPID
```  
  {{% /tab %}}
