# Localized Preview Link Test

This is the English version of the test page. This page exists to test whether localized content needs a corresponding English page to generate preview links properly.

## Test Purpose

This page was created because:
- Japanese and Korean versions of this page weren't getting preview links
- Modified pages worked fine, but new pages didn't
- We're testing if Hugo requires English versions for proper pageurls generation

If this fixes the issue, it means Hugo's pageurls generation requires pages to exist in the default language (English) first.
