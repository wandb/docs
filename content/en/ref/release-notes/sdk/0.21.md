## Notable Changes

This version removes the legacy implementation of the `service` process. This is a breaking change.

## Added

- Setting `x_stats_track_process_tree` to track process-specific metrics such as the RSS, CPU%, and thread count in use for the entire process tree, starting from `x_stats_pid`. This can be expensive and is disabled by default. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10089) -->
- Notes are now returned to the client when resuming a run. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9739) -->
- Added support for creating custom Vega chart presets through the API. Users can now define and upload custom chart specifications that can be then reused across runs with wandb.plot_table(). <!-- (@thanos-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9931) -->

## Changed

- Calling `Artifact.link()` no longer instantiates a throwaway placeholder run. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9828) -->
- `wandb` now attempts to use Unix sockets for IPC instead of listening on localhost, making it work in environments with more restrictive permissions (such as Databricks). <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9995) -->
- `Api.artifact()` will now display a warning while fetching artifacts from migrated model registry collections. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10047) -->
- The `.length` for objects queried from `wandb.Api` has been deprecated. Use `len(...)` instead. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10091) -->

## Removed

- Removed the legacy python implementation of the `service` process. The `legacy-service` option of `wandb.require` as well as the `x_require_legacy_service` and `x_disable_setproctitle` settings with the corresponding environment variables have been removed and will now raise an error if used. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9965) -->

- Removed the private `wandb.Run._metadata` attribute. To override the auto-detected CPU and GPU counts as well as the GPU type, please use the new settings `x_stats_{cpu_count,cpu_logical_count,gpu_count,gpu_type}`. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9984) -->

## Fixed

- Allow s3 style CoreWeave URIs for reference artifacts. <!-- (@estellazx in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9979) -->
- Fixed rare bug that made Ctrl+C ineffective after logging large amounts of data. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10071) -->
- Respect `silent`, `quiet`, and `show_warnings` settings passed to a `Run` instance for warnings emitted by the service process. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10077) -->
- `api.Runs` no longer makes an API call for each run loaded from W&B. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10087) -->
- Correctly parse the `x_extra_http_headers` setting from the env variable. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10103) -->
- `.length` calls the W&B backend to load the length of objects when no data has been loaded rather than returning `None`. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10091) -->

## v0.21.1

The default ordering for `Api().runs(...)` and `Api().sweeps(...)` is now ascending order based on the runs `created_at` time.

## Added

- Support `first` summary option in `define_metric`. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10121) -->
- Add support for paginated sweeps. <!-- (@nicholaspun-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10122) -->

## Changed

- `Api().runs(...)` and `Api().sweeps(...)` now returns runs in ascending order according to the runs `created_at` time. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10130) -->
- Artifact with large file (>2GB) uploads faster by using parallel hashing on system with more cores. <!-- (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10136) -->
- Remove the implementation of `__bool__` for the registry iterators to align with python lazy iterators. <!-- (@estellazx in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10259) -->

## Deprecated

- The `wandb.beta.workflows` module and its contents (including `log_model()`, `use_model()`, and `link_model()`) are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10205) -->

## Fixed

- Correct the artifact url for organization registry artifacts to be independent of the artifact type. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10049) -->
- Suffixes on sanitized `InternalArtifact` names have been shortened to 6 alphanumeric characters. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10102) -->

- Fixed registries fetched using `api.registries()` from having an extra `wandb-registry-` prefix in the name and full_name fields. <!-- (@estellazx in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10187) -->
- Fixed a crash that could happen when using `sync_tensorboard`. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10199) -->
- `Api().run(...).upload_file` no longer throws an error when uploading a file in a different path relative to the provided root directory. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10228) -->
- Calling `load()` function on a public API run object no longer throws `TypeError`. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10050) -->
- When a Sweeps run function called by `wandb.agent()` API throws an exception, it will now appear on the logs page for the run. (This previously only happened for runs called by the `wandb agent` CLI command.). <!-- (@kelu-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10244) -->

This version raises errors that would previously have been suppressed during calls to `Artifact.link()` or `Run.link_artifact()`. While this prevents undetected failures in those methods, it is also a breaking change.

## Added

- Add `x_disable_service_check` setting to disable service availability check. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10358) -->
- Add support for custom aliases when linking an artifact to a registry. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10392) -->

## Changed

- Calling `Artifact.link()` or `Run.link_artifact()` will now raise errors that would previously have been suppressed. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10362) -->

## Fixed

- `Api().runs(...)` and `Api().sweeps(...)` no longer return an incorrect order when the `order` parameter is supplied. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10350) -->
- `Api().run(...).upload_file` no longer throws an error when uploading a file in a different path relative to the provided root directory. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10228) -->
- Improve performance of artifact upload. <!-- (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10366) -->
- Fix artifact batch download. <!-- (@pingleiwandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10340) -->
- Fixed a bug where the wandb server and wandb service processes could fail to communicate in certain network configurations. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10389) -->

## Added

- Add DSPy integration: track evaluation metrics over time, log predictions and program signature evolution to W&B Tables, and save DSPy programs as W&B Artifacts (complete program or state as JSON/PKL). <!-- (@ayulockin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10327) -->

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused `wandb.log` to log incorrect values when `wandb.log` was called multiple times on the same step with the same metrics. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10456) -->
- Fix limiting azure reference artifact uploads to `max_objects`. <!-- (@estellazx in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/10491) -->
