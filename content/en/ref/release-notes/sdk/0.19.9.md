## Added

- The `reinit` setting can be set to `"default"`. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9569) -->
- Added support for building artifact file download urls using the new url scheme, with artifact collection membership context. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9560) -->

## Changed

- Boolean values for the `reinit` setting are deprecated; use "return_previous" and "finish_previous" instead. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9557) -->
- The "wandb" logger is configured with `propagate=False` at import time, whereas it previously happened when starting a run. This may change the messages observed by the root logger in some workflows. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9540) -->
- Metaflow now requires `plum-dispatch` package. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9599) -->
- Relaxed the `pydantic` version requirement to support both v1 and v2. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9605) -->
- Existing `pydantic` types have been adapted to be compatible with Pydantic v1. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9623) -->
- `wandb.init(dir=...)` now creates any nonexistent directories in `dir` if it has a parent directory that is writeable. <!-- (@ringohoffman in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9545) -->
- The server now supports fetching artifact files by providing additional collection information; updated the artifacts api to use the new endpoints instead. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9551) -->
- Paginated methods (and underlying paginators) that accept a `per_page` argument now only accept `int` values. Default `per_page` values are set directly in method signatures, and explicitly passing `None` is no longer supported. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9201) -->

## Fixed

- Calling `wandb.init()` in a notebook finishes previous runs as previously documented. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9569) -->
- Bug introduced in 0.19.0.
- Fixed an error being thrown when logging `jpg`/`jpeg` images containing transparency data. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9527) -->
- `wandb.init(resume_from=...)` now works without explicitly specifying the run's `id`. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9572) -->
- Deleting files with the Public API works again. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9604) -->
- Bug introduced in 0.19.1.
- Fixed media files not displaying in the UI when logging to a run with a custom storage bucket. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9661) -->
