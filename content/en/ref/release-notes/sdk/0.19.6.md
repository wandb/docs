## Added

- Prometheus API support for Nvidia DCGM GPU metrics collection. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9369) -->

## Changed

- Changed Nvidia GPU ECC counters from aggregated to volatile. <!-- (@gritukan in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9347) -->

## Fixed

- Fixed a performance issue causing slow instantiation of `wandb.Artifact`, which in turn slowed down fetching artifacts in various API methods. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9355) -->
- Some errors from `wandb.Api` have better string representations. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9361) -->
- Artifact.add_reference, when used with file URIs for a directory and the name parameter, was incorrectly adding the value of `name` to the path of the file references. <!-- (@ssisk in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9378) -->
- Fixed a bug causing `Artifact.add_reference()` with `checksum=False` to log new versions of local reference artifacts without changes to the reference URI. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9326) -->
