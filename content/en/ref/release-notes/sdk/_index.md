This section includes release notes for the [W&B Python SDK]({{< relref "/ref/python/" >}}) (`wandb` package).

<a href="/ref/release-notes/sdk/index.xml"><button class="btn btn-primary mb-4 feedback--answer"><i class="fa-sharp fa-regular fa-square-rss" alt="RSS icon"></i>&nbsp;RSS feed</button></a> (SDK only)

When it is released, a new SDK version is compatible with W&B Multi-tenant Cloud, W&B Dedicated Cloud, and supported releases of W&B Self-Managed. W&B recommends that you start with the newest release and upgrade it regularly.

For the latest SDK releases and source code, visit the [wandb/wandb GitHub repository](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/releases). For W&B Server, see [W&B Server release notes](../server/).
