- Possibly fixed some cases where the `output.log` file was not being uploaded.
- Fixed excessive data uploads when calling `run.save()` repeatedly on unchanged files.

## v0.22.1
**September 29, 2025**

### Added

- Optimize artifacts downloads re-verification with checksum caching.
- Lazy loading support for `Api().runs()` to improve performance when listing runs. The new `lazy=True` parameter (default) loads only essential metadata initially, with automatic on-demand loading of heavy fields like config and summary when accessed.
- Add `storage_region` option when creating artifacts. Users can use [CoreWeave AI Object Storage](https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/products/storage/object-storage) by specifying `wandb.Artifact(storage_region="coreweave-us")` when using wandb.ai for faster artifact upload/download on CoreWeave's infrastructure.


### Fixed

- `Api.artifact_exists()` and `Api.artifact_collection_exists()` now raise on encountering timeout errors, rather than (potentially erroneously) returning `False`.

## v0.22.0

## Notable Changes

This version removes support of MacOS 10.

### Removed

- Remove a build targeting MacOS 10.x due to multiple security and supply chain considerations.

### Fixed

- Resuming a run with a different active run will now raise an error unless you call `run.finish()` first, or call `wandb.init()` with the parameter `reinit='create_new'`.
- Fix `Api().runs()` for wandb server < 0.51.0 (when `project.internalId` was added to gql API).
- Sweeps: `command` run scripts that `import readline` whether directly or indirectly (e.g. `import torch` on Python 3.13) should no longer deadlock.
