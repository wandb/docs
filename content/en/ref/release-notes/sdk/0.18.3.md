## Added

- Add the ability to monitor the utilization metrics of Google's Cloud TPU devices. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8504) -->

## Fixed

- Capture Nvidia GPU stats on Windows. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8524) -->
- Fixed a regression introduced in v0.18.2 that affected capturing the names of Nvidia GPU devices. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8503) -->
- `run.log_artifact()` no longer blocks other data uploads until the artifact upload finishes. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8466) -->
- Fixed media dependency for rdkit updated from `rdkit-pypi` to `rdkit`. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/compare/WB-20894) -->
- Saving an artifact with many large files no longer exhausts OS threads. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8518) -->

## Changed

- After `artifact = run.log_artifact()`, you must use `artifact.wait()` before operations that rely on the artifact having been uploaded. Previously, this wasn't necessary in some cases because `run.log_artifact()` blocked other operations on the run. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8466) -->
