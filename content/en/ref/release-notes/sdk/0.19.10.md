## Added

- The new `reinit="create_new"` setting causes `wandb.init()` to create a new run even if other runs are active, without finishing the other runs (in contrast to `reinit="finish_previous"`). This will eventually become the default. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9562) -->
- Added `Artifact.history_step` to return the nearest run step at which history metrics were logged for the artifact's source run. <!-- (@ibindlish in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9732) -->
- Added `data_is_not_path` flag to skip file checks when initializing `wandb.Html` with a sting that points to a file.

## Changed

- `Artifact.download()` no longer raises an error when using `WANDB_MODE=offline` or when an offline run exists. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9695) -->

## Removed

- Dropped the `-q` / `--quiet` argument to the `wandb` magic in IPython / Jupyter; use the `quiet` run setting instead. <!-- (@timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9705) -->

## Deprecated

- The following `wandb.Run` methods are deprecated in favor of properties and will be removed in a future release (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8925):.
- `run.project_name()` is deprecated in favor of `run.project`.
- `run.get_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.url`.
- `run.get_project_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.project_url`.
- `run.get_sweep_url()` method is deprecated in favor of `run.sweep_url`.


## Fixed

- Fixed ValueError on Windows when running a W&B script from a different drive. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9678) -->
- Fix base_url setting was not provided to wandb.login. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9703) -->
- `wandb.Html()` no longer raises `IsADirectoryError` with a value that matched a directory on the users system. <!-- (@jacobromero in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/9728) -->
