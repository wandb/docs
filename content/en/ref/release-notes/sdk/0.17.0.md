## Notable Changes

Renamed `wandb.plots` to `wandb.plot`, renamed all integrations from `wandb.<name>` to `wandb.integration.<name>`, and removed the `[async]` extra.

This version packages the `wandb-core` binary, formerly installed by the `wandb-core` Python package on PyPI. The `wandb-core` package is now unused and can be uninstalled.

## Added

- The `wandb` package now includes the `wandb-core` binary. <!-- by @timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7381 -->
- `wandb-core` is a new and improved backend for the W&B SDK that focuses on performance, versatility, and robustness.
- Currently, it is opt-in. To start using the new backend, add `wandb.require("core")` to your script after importing `wandb`.
- `wandb-core` now supports Artifact file caching. <!-- by @moredatarequired in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7364 and https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7366 -->
- Added artifact_exists() and artifact_collection_exists() methods to Api to check if an artifact or collection exists. <!-- by @amusipatla-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7483 -->
- `wandb launch -u <git-uri | local-path> ` creates and launches a job from the given source code. <!-- by @bcsherma in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7485 -->

## Fixed

- Prevent crash on `run.summary` for finished runs. <!-- by @dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7440 -->
- Correctly report file upload errors when using wandb-core. <!-- by @moredatarequired in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7196 -->
- Implemented a stricter check for AMD GPU availability. <!-- by @dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7322 -->
- Fixed `run.save()` on Windows. <!-- by @timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7412 -->
- Show a warning instead of failing when using registries other than ECR and GAR with the Kaniko builder. <!-- by @TimH98 in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7461 -->
- Fixed `wandb.init()` type signature including `None`. <!-- by @timoffex in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7563 -->

## Changed

- When using `wandb-core` need to specify a required flag (`wandb.require("core")`) to enable it, before it was picked up automatically. <!-- by @kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7228 -->
- Use ETags instead of MD5 hashes for GCS reference artifacts. <!-- by @moredatarequired in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7337 -->

Please use `wandb.plot` instead of `wandb.plots` and `wandb.integration.[catboost,fastai,keras,lightgbm,sacred,xgboost]` instead of `wandb.[catboost,fastai,keras,lightgbm,sacred,xgboost]`. By @dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7552.
