## Notable Changes

This version switches `wandb` to a new backend by enabling `wandb.require("core")` by default. This should not be a breaking change, but the new backend may have unexpected differences in behavior for legacy functionality and rare edge cases.

## Added

- Add support for artifact tags, via `Artifact.tags` and `Run.log_artifact()`. <!-- (@tonyyli-wandb in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8085) -->

## Fixed

- Detect the notebook name in VS Code's built-in jupyter server. <!-- (@dmitryduev in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/8311) -->

## Changed

- The new "core" backend, previously activated using wandb.require("core"), is now used by default. To revert to the legacy behavior, add `wandb.require("legacy-service")` at the beginning of your script. Note: In a future minor release, the option to disable this new behavior will be removed. <!-- (@kptkin in https://github.com/wandb/wandb/pull/7777) -->
