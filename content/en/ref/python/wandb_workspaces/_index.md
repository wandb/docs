The W&B Reports and Workspaces API, accessible at `wandb_workspaces`, allows you to create [reports]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports" >}}), which can be published on the web to share findings, and well as customize a [workspace]({{< relref "/guides/models/app/features/cascade-settings" >}}) where training and fine-tuning work was done.
