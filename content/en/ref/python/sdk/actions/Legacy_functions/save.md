### <kbd>function</kbd> `wandb.save`

```python
wandb.save(
    glob_str: 'str | os.PathLike',
    base_path: 'str | os.PathLike | None' = None,
    policy: 'PolicyName' = 'live'
) â†’ bool | list[str]
```

Sync one or more files to W&B. 

Relative paths are relative to the current working directory. 

A Unix glob, such as "myfiles/*", is expanded at the time `save` is called regardless of the `policy`. In particular, new files are not picked up automatically. 

A `base_path` may be provided to control the directory structure of uploaded files. It should be a prefix of `glob_str`, and the directory structure beneath it is preserved. 

When given an absolute path or glob and no `base_path`, one directory level is preserved as in the example above. 



**Args:**
 
 - `glob_str`:  A relative or absolute path or Unix glob. 
 - `base_path`:  A path to use to infer a directory structure; see examples. 
 - `policy`:  One of `live`, `now`, or `end`. 
    - live: upload the file as it changes, overwriting the previous version 
    - now: upload the file once now 
    - end: upload file when the run ends 



**Returns:**
 Paths to the symlinks created for the matched files. 

For historical reasons, this may return a boolean in legacy code. 

```python
import wandb

wandb.init()

wandb.save("these/are/myfiles/*")
# => Saves files in a "these/are/myfiles/" folder in the run.

wandb.save("these/are/myfiles/*", base_path="these")
# => Saves files in an "are/myfiles/" folder in the run.

wandb.save("/User/username/Documents/run123/*.txt")
# => Saves files in a "run123/" folder in the run. See note below.

wandb.save("/User/username/Documents/run123/*.txt", base_path="/User")
# => Saves files in a "username/Documents/run123/" folder in the run.

wandb.save("files/*/saveme.txt")
# => Saves each "saveme.txt" file in an appropriate subdirectory
#    of "files/".
```
