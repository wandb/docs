The W&B Python SDK, accessible at `wandb`, enables you to train and fine-tune models, and manage models from experimentation to production. 

> After performing your training and fine-tuning operations with this SDK, you can use [the Public API]({{< relref "/ref/python/public-api" >}}) to query and analyze the data that was logged, and [the Reports and Workspaces API]({{< relref "/ref/python/wandb_workspaces" >}}) to generate a web-publishable [report]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports" >}}) summarizing your work.
