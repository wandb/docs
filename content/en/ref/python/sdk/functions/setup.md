### <kbd>function</kbd> `setup`

```python
setup(settings: 'Settings | None' = None) → _WandbSetup
```

Prepares W&B for use in the current process and its children. 

You can usually ignore this as it is implicitly called by `wandb.init()`. 

When using wandb in multiple processes, calling `wandb.setup()` in the parent process before starting child processes may improve performance and resource utilization. 

Note that `wandb.setup()` modifies `os.environ`, and it is important that child processes inherit the modified environment variables. 

See also `wandb.teardown()`. 



**Args:**
 
 - `settings`:  Configuration settings to apply globally. These can be  overridden by subsequent `wandb.init()` calls. 



**Example:**
 ```python
import multiprocessing

import wandb


def run_experiment(params):
    with wandb.init(config=params):
         # Run experiment
         pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Start backend and set global config
    wandb.setup(settings={"project": "my_project"})

    # Define experiment parameters
    experiment_params = [
         {"learning_rate": 0.01, "epochs": 10},
         {"learning_rate": 0.001, "epochs": 20},
    ]

    # Start multiple processes, each running a separate experiment
    processes = []
    for params in experiment_params:
         p = multiprocessing.Process(target=run_experiment, args=(params,))
         p.start()
         processes.append(p)

    # Wait for all processes to complete
    for p in processes:
         p.join()

    # Optional: Explicitly shut down the backend
    wandb.teardown()
```
