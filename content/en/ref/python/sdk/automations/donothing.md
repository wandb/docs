{{< cta-button githubLink=https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/main/wandb/automations/actions.py >}}



Defines an automation action that intentionally does nothing.

Attributes:
- action_type (Literal): The kind of action to be triggered.
- no_op (bool): Placeholder field which exists only to satisfy backend schema requirements.
    There should never be a need to set this field explicitly, as its value is ignored.
