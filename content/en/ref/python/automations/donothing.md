{{< cta-button githubLink=https://www.github.com/wandb/wandb/tree/v0.19.11/wandb/automations/actions.py#L192-L201 >}}

Defines an automation action that intentionally does nothing.

| Attributes |  |
| :--- | :--- |
|  `no_op` |  Placeholder field which exists only to satisfy backend schema requirements. There should never be a need to set this field explicitly, as its value is ignored. |
|  `action_type` |  The kind of action to be triggered. |
