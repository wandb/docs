Now in public preview, W&B Training offers serverless reinforcement learning (RL) for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reliability performing multi-turn, agentic tasks while also increasing speed and reducing costs. 

W&B Training includes integration with [ART](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/about), a flexible RL fine-tuning framework; [RULER](https://openpipe.ai/blog/ruler), a universal verifier; and a fully managed serverless RL backend on CoreWeave cloud, so you can run RL training loops without provisioning, configuring, or managing GPUs and infrastructure.

Learn how to use W&B Training's [Serverless RL]({{< relref "/guides/training/serverless-rl" >}}) to post-train your models.
