Serverless RL is supported through [OpenPipe's ART framework](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/about) and the [W&B Training API]({{< relref "ref/training" >}}). 

To start using Serverless RL, satisfy the [prerequisites]({{< relref "guides/training/prerequisites.md" >}}) to use W&B tools, and then see the ART [quickstart](https://art.openpipe.ai/getting-started/quick-start) (or see the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/openpipe/art-notebooks/blob/main/examples/2048/2048.ipynb)) for code examples and workflows. To learn about Serverless RL's API endpoints, see the [W&B Training API reference]({{< relref "ref/training" >}}).
