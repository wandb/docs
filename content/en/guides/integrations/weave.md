Use the W&B Weave integration to automatically initialize Weave whenever you start a W&B run. As long as you call `wandb.init()` and import `weave` in your process, Weave will auto-initialize and begin capturing traces with zero additional setup.

[Learn more about Weave here](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/)!

## Install Weave

Install the Weave library (and W&B if you have not already):

```bash
pip install wandb weave
```

## Auto-initialize Weave with W&B

Initialize a W&B run and import Weave. No extra configuration is requiredâ€”Weave will auto-init for you.

```python
import wandb
import weave

wandb.init(project="weave-demo")

# Weave is now auto-initialized and ready to capture traces.
# Use your code as usual; traces will be associated with this W&B run.
```

## View your traces

Open the W&B run page linked in your console output after `wandb.init()`. Your Weave traces will be visible in the run, making it easy to explore, compare, and share results.
