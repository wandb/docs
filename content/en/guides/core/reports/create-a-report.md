Create a report programmatically:

1. Install W&B SDK (`wandb`) and Report and Workspace API (`wandb-workspaces`):
    ```bash
    pip install wandb wandb-workspaces
    ```
2. Next, import workspaces
    ```python
    import wandb
    import wandb_workspaces.reports.v2 as wr
    ```       
3. Create a report with `wandb_workspaces.reports.v2.Report`. Create a report instance with the Report Class Public API ([`wandb.apis.reports`]({{< relref "/ref/python/public-api/api.md#reports" >}})). Specify a name for the project.   
    ```python
    report = wr.Report(project="report_standard")
    ```  

4. Save the report. Reports are not uploaded to the W&B server until you call the .`save()` method:
    ```python
    report.save()
    ```

For information on how to edit a report interactively with the App UI or programmatically, see [Edit a report]({{< relref "/guides/core/reports/edit-a-report" >}}).
