## Disk

By default, the usage metrics are collected for the `/` path. To configure the paths to be monitored, use the following setting:

```python
run = wandb.init(
    settings=wandb.Settings(
        x_stats_disk_paths=("/System/Volumes/Data", "/home", "/mnt/data"),
    ),
)
```

### Disk Usage Percent
Represents the total system disk usage in percentage for specified paths.

W&B assigns a `disk.{path}.usagePercent` tag to this metric.

### Disk Usage
Represents the total system disk usage in gigabytes (GB) for specified paths.
The paths that are accessible are sampled, and the disk usage (in GB) for each path is appended to the samples.

W&B assigns a `disk.{path}.usageGB` tag to this metric.

### Disk In
Indicates the total system disk read in megabytes (MB). 
The initial disk read bytes are recorded when the first sample is taken. Subsequent samples calculate the difference between the current read bytes and the initial value.

W&B assigns a `disk.in` tag to this metric.

### Disk Out
Represents the total system disk write in megabytes (MB). 
Similar to [Disk In]({{< relref "#disk-in" >}}), the initial disk write bytes are recorded when the first sample is taken. Subsequent samples calculate the difference between the current write bytes and the initial value.

W&B assigns a `disk.out` tag to this metric.

### Network Received

Indicates the total bytes received over the network.
Similar to [Network Sent]({{< relref "#network-sent" >}}), the initial bytes received are recorded when the metric is first initialized. Subsequent samples calculate the difference between the current bytes received and the initial value.

## Graphcore IPU
Graphcore IPUs (Intelligence Processing Units) are unique hardware accelerators designed specifically for machine intelligence tasks.

### IPU Device Metrics
These metrics represent various statistics for a specific IPU device. Each metric has a device ID (`device_id`) and a metric key (`metric_key`) to identify it. W&B assigns a `ipu.{device_id}.{metric_key}` tag to this metric.

Metrics are extracted using the proprietary `gcipuinfo` library, which interacts with Graphcore's `gcipuinfo` binary. The `sample` method fetches these metrics for each IPU device associated with the process ID (`pid`). Only the metrics that change over time, or the first time a device's metrics are fetched, are logged to avoid logging redundant data.

For each metric, the method `parse_metric` is used to extract the metric's value from its raw string representation. The metrics are then aggregated across multiple samples using the `aggregate` method.

The following lists available metrics and their units:

- **Average Board Temperature** (`average board temp (C)`): Temperature of the IPU board in Celsius.
- **Average Die Temperature** (`average die temp (C)`): Temperature of the IPU die in Celsius.
- **Clock Speed** (`clock (MHz)`): The clock speed of the IPU in MHz.
- **IPU Power** (`ipu power (W)`): Power consumption of the IPU in Watts.
- **IPU Utilization** (`ipu utilisation (%)`): Percentage of IPU utilization.
- **IPU Session Utilization** (`ipu utilisation (session) (%)`): IPU utilization percentage specific to the current session.
- **Data Link Speed** (`speed (GT/s)`): Speed of data transmission in Giga-transfers per second.
