## Configure a media panel
Panels for all media types have the same options.

When you add a media panel manually, its configuration page opens after you select the type of media. To update the configuration for an existing panel, hover over the panel, then click the gear icon that appears at the top right. This section describes the settings available in each tab.

### Overlays
This tab appears for images and point clouds logged with segmentation masks or bounding boxes.
- Search and filter overlays by name.
- Customize overlay colors.

### Display
Customize the panel's overall appearance and behavior.
- Configure the panel's title.
- Select the media keys to visualize.
- Customize the panel's slider and playback behavior.
  - Configure the slider key, which defaults to **Step**.
  - Set **Stride length** to the number of steps to advance for each click of the slider.
  - Turn on or off **Snap to existing step**. If it is turned on, the stepper advances to the next existing step after **Stride length**. Otherwise, it advances by **Stride length** even if that does not align with an existing step.
- **Images**: Turn on or off smoothing.
- **3d objects**: Configure the background color and point color.

### Layout
Customize the display of the panel's individual items.
- Turn on or off **Grid mode**.
  - When it is turned on, you can choose a custom X and Y axis to plot on top of each item. More than one item displays in each row, and you limit how many rows to show.
  - When it is turned off, you can customize the number of columns to use for the panel's content, and you can configure the panel's content, which defaults to **Run**.
- Optionally limit the **Max runs to include** in the panel.
- Optionally specify a **Media display limit** to limit the number of media items to include per run.
- **Images and videos**: Turn on or off display of full-size media.
- **Images**: When **Fit media** is turned on, resize the panel's media to fit the panel's size.
- **Point clouds**: Optionally turn on the right-handed system for plotting points, rather than the default left-handed system.
