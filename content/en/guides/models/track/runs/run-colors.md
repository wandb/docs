W&B automatically assigns a color to each run that you create in your project. You can customize these colors to help you visually distinguish runs in tables and graphs. Run colors are locally scoped—on the project page, custom colors apply only to your own workspace. In reports, custom colors for runs apply only at the section level.

## Choose a color palette

W&B provides several predefined color palettes to suit different needs and preferences. You can select a palette that works best for your team and use case.


1. Navigate to your W&B project.
2. Click on the **Workspace** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Click the **Settings** icon in the top right corner.
4. Select **Runs** from the settings drawer.
5. In the **Color palette** section, choose from the available options.

### Available color palettes

W&B offers three color palette options:

- **Default**: The standard W&B color palette with a vibrant range of colors
- **Colorblind-safe (deuteranomaly)**: Optimized for red-green color blindness, the most common form.
- **Colorblind-safe (all other forms)**: Optimized for protanopia, tritanopia, and other forms of color vision difference.

The colorblind-safe palettes use colors that remain distinguishable across different types of color vision difference, while maintaining visual appeal for users with typical color vision.

#### Default palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the default palette, displaying a variety of vibrant colors for different runs.

#### Colorblind-safe (deuteranomaly) palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the colorblind-safe palette optimized for deuteranomaly (red-green color blindness), using colors that remain distinguishable for affected users.

#### Colorblind-safe (all other forms) palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the colorblind-safe palette optimized for protanopia, tritanopia, and other forms of color vision difference.

2. Click the dot color next to the run name in the **Name** column.
3. Select a color from the color palette or the color picker, or enter a hex code.

## Randomize run colors

To randomize the colors of all runs in the table:

1. Click the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Hover over the **Name** column header, click the three horizontal dots (**...**), and select **Randomize run colors** from the dropdown menu.

The option to randomize run colors is available only after modifying the run's table in some way, such as by sorting, filtering, searching, or grouping.

## Color options for grouped runs

When using the **Run colors** setting, you have two options:

- **Original project colors**: Uses the default color assignment for runs.
- **Key-based colors**: Colors runs based on metric or configuration values (see [Semantic run plot legends]({{< relref "color-code-runs" >}}) for details).

## Reset run colors

To restore the default colors for all runs in the table:

1. Click the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Hover over the **Name** column header, click the three horizontal dots (**...**), and select **Reset colors** from the dropdown menu.
