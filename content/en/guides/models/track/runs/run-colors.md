W&B automatically assigns a color to each run that you create in your project. You can customize these colors to help you visually distinguish runs in tables and graphs. Run colors are locally scopedâ€”on the project page, custom colors apply only to your own workspace. In reports, custom colors for runs apply only at the section level.

## Choose a color palette

W&B provides several predefined color palettes to suit different needs and preferences. You can select a palette that works best for your team and use case.


1. Navigate to your W&B project.
2. Click on the **Workspace** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Click the **Settings** icon in the top right corner.
4. Select **Runs** from the settings drawer.
5. In the **Color palette** section, choose from the available options.

### Available color palettes

W&B offers three color palette options:

- **Default**: The standard W&B color palette with a vibrant range of colors
- **Colorblind-safe (deuteranomaly)**: Optimized for red-green color blindness, the most common form.
- **Colorblind-safe (all other forms)**: Optimized for protanopia, tritanopia, and other forms of color vision difference.

The colorblind-safe palettes use colors that remain distinguishable across different types of color vision difference, while maintaining visual appeal for users with typical color vision.

#### Default palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the default palette, displaying a variety of vibrant colors for different runs.

#### Colorblind-safe (deuteranomaly) palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the colorblind-safe palette optimized for deuteranomaly (red-green color blindness), using colors that remain distinguishable for affected users.

#### Colorblind-safe (all other forms) palette
In this example plot, runs are colored with the colorblind-safe palette optimized for protanopia, tritanopia, and other forms of color vision difference.

## Randomize run colors

To randomize the colors of all runs in the table:

1. Click the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Hover over the **Name** column header, click the three horizontal dots (**...**), and select **Randomize run colors** from the dropdown menu.

The option to randomize run colors is available only after modifying the run's table in some way, such as by sorting, filtering, searching, or grouping.

## Color options for grouped runs

When using the **Run colors** setting, you have two options:

- **Original project colors**: Uses the default color assignment for runs.
- **Key-based colors**: Colors runs based on metric or configuration values (see [Semantic run plot legends]({{< relref "color-code-runs" >}}) for details).

## Reset run colors

To restore the default colors for all runs in the table:

1. Click the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Hover over the **Name** column header, click the three horizontal dots (**...**), and select **Reset colors** from the dropdown menu.
