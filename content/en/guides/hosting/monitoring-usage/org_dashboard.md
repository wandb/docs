1. To access the **Organization Dashboard**, navigate to `https://<org-name>.io/org/dashboard/`. Replace `<org-name>` with your organization name. The **Users** tab opens by default. It lists all users, along with data about each user.
1. To sort the list by user status, click the **Last Active** column label. Each user's status is one of the following:

    * **Invite pending**: Admin has sent invite but user has not accepted invitation. 
    * **Active**: User has accepted the invite and created an account.
    * **-**: The user was previously active but has not been active in the last 6 months.
    * **Deactivated**: Admin has revoked access of the user.
1. To see details about a user's last activity, hover your mouse over the **Last Active** field for the user.  A tooltip appears that shows when the user was added and how many total days the user has been active.

    A user is _active_ if they:
    - log in to W&B.
    - view any page in the W&B App.
    - log runs.
    - use the SDK to track an experiment.
    - interact with the W&B Server in any way.
