This notebook shows how to use W&B Weave together with W&B Models. Specifically, this example considers two different teams.

* **The Model Team:** the model building team fine-tunes a new Chat Model (Llama 3.2) and saves it to the registry using **W&B Models**.
* **The App Team:** the app development team retrieves the Chat Model to create and evaluate a new RAG chatbot using **W&B Weave**.

Find the public workspace for both W&B Models and W&B Weave [here](https://wandb.ai/wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/weave/evaluations).

The workflow covers the following steps:

1. Instrument the RAG app code with W&B Weave
2. Fine-tune an LLM (such as Llama 3.2, but you can replace it with any other LLM) and track it with W&B Models
3. Log the fine-tuned model to the [W&B Registry](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/core/registry)
4. Implement the RAG app with the new fine-tuned model and evaluate the app with W&B Weave
5. Once satisfied with the results, save a reference to the updated Rag app in the W&B Registry

**Note:**

The `RagModel` referenced below is top-level `weave.Model` that you can consider a complete RAG app. It contains a `ChatModel`, Vector database, and a Prompt. The `ChatModel` is also another `weave.Model` which contains the code to download an artifact from the W&B Registry and it can change to support any other chat model as part of the `RagModel`. For more details see [the complete model on Weave](https://wandb.ai/wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/weave/evaluations?peekPath=%2Fwandb-smle%2Fweave-cookboook-demo%2Fobjects%2FRagModel%2Fversions%2Fx7MzcgHDrGXYHHDQ9BA8N89qDwcGkdSdpxH30ubm8ZM%3F%26). 

## 1. Setup
First, install `weave` and `wandb`, then log in with an API key. You can create and view your API keys at https://wandb.ai/settings. 

```bash
pip install weave wandb
```

```python
import wandb
import weave
import pandas as pd

PROJECT = "weave-cookboook-demo"
ENTITY = "wandb-smle"

wandb.login()
weave.init(ENTITY + "/" + PROJECT)
```

## 2. Make `ChatModel` based on Artifact

Retrieve the fine-tuned chat model from the Registry and create a `weave.Model` from it to directly plug into the [`RagModel`](https://wandb.ai/wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/weave/object-versions?filter=%7B%22objectName%22%3A%22RagModel%22%7D&peekPath=%2Fwandb-smle%2Fweave-cookboook-demo%2Fobjects%2FRagModel%2Fversions%2FcqRaGKcxutBWXyM0fCGTR1Yk2mISLsNari4wlGTwERo%3F%26) in the next step. It takes in the same parameters as the existing [ChatModel](https://wandb.ai/wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/weave/object-versions?filter=%7B%22objectName%22%3A%22RagModel%22%7D&peekPath=%2Fwandb-smle%2Fweave-rag-experiments%2Fobjects%2FChatModelRag%2Fversions%2F2mhdPb667uoFlXStXtZ0MuYoxPaiAXj3KyLS1kYRi84%3F%26) just the `init` and `predict` change.

```bash
pip install unsloth
pip uninstall unsloth -y && pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir "unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"
```

The model team fine-tuned different Llama-3.2 models using the `unsloth` library to make it faster. Hence use the special `unsloth.FastLanguageModel` or `peft.AutoPeftModelForCausalLM` models with adapters to load in the model once downloaded from the Registry. Copy the loading code from the "Use" tab in the Registry and paste it into `model_post_init`.

```python
import weave
from pydantic import PrivateAttr
from typing import Any, List, Dict, Optional
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
import torch


class UnslothLoRAChatModel(weave.Model):
    """
    Define an extra ChatModel class to store and version more parameters than just the model name.
    This enables fine-tuning on specific parameters.
    """

    chat_model: str
    cm_temperature: float
    cm_max_new_tokens: int
    cm_quantize: bool
    inference_batch_size: int
    dtype: Any
    device: str
    _model: Any = PrivateAttr()
    _tokenizer: Any = PrivateAttr()

    def model_post_init(self, __context):
        run = wandb.init(project=PROJECT, job_type="model_download")
        artifact_ref = self.chat_model.replace("wandb-artifact:///", "")
        artifact = run.use_artifact(artifact_ref)
        model_path = artifact.download()

        # unsloth version (enable native 2x faster inference)
        self._model, self._tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
            model_name=model_path,
            max_seq_length=self.cm_max_new_tokens,
            dtype=self.dtype,
            load_in_4bit=self.cm_quantize,
        )
        FastLanguageModel.for_inference(self._model)

    @weave.op()
    async def predict(self, query: List[str]) -> dict:
        # add_generation_prompt = true - Must add for generation
        input_ids = self._tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
            query,
            tokenize=True,
            add_generation_prompt=True,
            return_tensors="pt",
        ).to("cuda")

        output_ids = self._model.generate(
            input_ids=input_ids,
            max_new_tokens=64,
            use_cache=True,
            temperature=1.5,
            min_p=0.1,
        )

        decoded_outputs = self._tokenizer.batch_decode(
            output_ids[0][input_ids.shape[1] :], skip_special_tokens=True
        )

        return "".join(decoded_outputs).strip()
```

Now create a new model with a specific link from the registry:

```python
ORG_ENTITY = "wandb32"  # replace this with your organization name
artifact_name = "Finetuned Llama-3.2" # replace this with your artifact name
MODEL_REG_URL = f"wandb-artifact:///{ORG_ENTITY}/wandb-registry-RAG Chat Models/{artifact_name}:v3"

max_seq_length = 2048
dtype = None
load_in_4bit = True

new_chat_model = UnslothLoRAChatModel(
    name="UnslothLoRAChatModelRag",
    chat_model=MODEL_REG_URL,
    cm_temperature=1.0,
    cm_max_new_tokens=max_seq_length,
    cm_quantize=load_in_4bit,
    inference_batch_size=max_seq_length,
    dtype=dtype,
    device="auto",
)
```

 And finally run the evaluation asynchronously:

 ```python
 await new_chat_model.predict(
     [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Germany?"}]
 )
 ```

## 3. Integrate new `ChatModel` version into `RagModel`
Building a RAG app from a fine-tuned chat model can provide several advantages, particularly in enhancing the performance and versatility of conversational AI systems.

Now retrieve the [`RagModel`](https://wandb.ai/wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/weave/object-versions?filter=%7B%22objectName%22%3A%22RagModel%22%7D&peekPath=%2Fwandb-smle%2Fweave-cookboook-demo%2Fobjects%2FRagModel%2Fversions%2FcqRaGKcxutBWXyM0fCGTR1Yk2mISLsNari4wlGTwERo%3F%26) (you can fetch the weave ref for the current `RagModel` from the use tab as shown in the image below) from the existing Weave project and exchange the `ChatModel` to the new one. There is no need to change or re-create any of the other components (VDB, prompts, etc.)!

{{< img src="/images/tutorials/weave-ref-1.png" alt="Weave UI 'Use' tab with reference code" >}}

```bash
pip install litellm faiss-gpu
```

```python
RagModel = weave.ref(
    "weave:///wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/object/RagModel:cqRaGKcxutBWXyM0fCGTR1Yk2mISLsNari4wlGTwERo"
).get()
# MAGIC: exchange chat_model and publish new version (no need to worry about other RAG components)
RagModel.chat_model = new_chat_model
# First publish the new version so that it is referenced during predictions
PUB_REFERENCE = weave.publish(RagModel, "RagModel")
await RagModel.predict("When was the first conference on climate change?")
```

## 4. Run new `weave.Evaluation` connecting to the existing models run
Finally, evaluate the new `RagModel` on the existing `weave.Evaluation`. To make the integration as easy as possible, include the following changes. 

From a Models perspective:
- Getting the model from the registry creates a new `run` object which is part of the E2E lineage of the chat model
- Add the Trace ID (with current eval ID) to the run config so that the model team can click the link to go to the corresponding Weave page

From a Weave perspective:
- Save the artifact / registry link as input to the `ChatModel` (that is `RagModel`)
- Save the run.id as extra column in the traces with `weave.attributes`

```python
# MAGIC: get an evaluation with a eval dataset and scorers and use them
WEAVE_EVAL = "weave:///wandb-smle/weave-cookboook-demo/object/climate_rag_eval:ntRX6qn3Tx6w3UEVZXdhIh1BWGh7uXcQpOQnIuvnSgo"
climate_rag_eval = weave.ref(WEAVE_EVAL).get()

run = wandb.init()

with weave.attributes({"wandb-run-id": run.id}):
    # use .call attribute to retrieve both the result and the call in order to save eval trace to Models
    summary, call = await climate_rag_eval.evaluate.call(climate_rag_eval, ` RagModel `)
```

## 5. Save the new RAG model on the Registry
In order to effectively share the new RAG Model, push it to the Registry as a reference artifact adding in the weave version as an alias.

```python
MODELS_OBJECT_VERSION = PUB_REFERENCE.digest  # weave object version
MODELS_OBJECT_NAME = PUB_REFERENCE.name  # weave object name

models_url = f"https://wandb.ai/{ENTITY}/{PROJECT}/weave/objects/{MODELS_OBJECT_NAME}/versions/{MODELS_OBJECT_VERSION}"
models_link = (
    f"weave:///{ENTITY}/{PROJECT}/object/{MODELS_OBJECT_NAME}:{MODELS_OBJECT_VERSION}"
)

with wandb.init(project=PROJECT, entity=ENTITY) as run:
    # create new Artifact
    artifact_model = wandb.Artifact(
        name="RagModel",
        type="model",
        description="Models Link from RagModel in Weave",
        metadata={"url": models_url},
    )
    artifact_model.add_reference(models_link, name="model", checksum=False)

    # log new artifact
    run.log_artifact(artifact_model, aliases=[MODELS_OBJECT_VERSION])

    # link to registry
    run.link_artifact(
        artifact_model, target_path="wandb32/wandb-registry-RAG Models/RAG Model"
    )
```
