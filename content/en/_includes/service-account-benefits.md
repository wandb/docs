Key benefits of service accounts:
- **No license consumption**: Service accounts do not consume user seats or licenses
- **Dedicated API keys**: Secure, non-expiring credentials for automated workflows
- **Flexible scoping**: Available at both organization and team levels
- **User attribution**: Optionally attribute automated runs to human users
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built for production automation at scale
- **Limited permissions**: Service accounts can be created with a restricted set of permissions compared to the human user that owns them
- **Delegated operations**: Service accounts operate on behalf of the user or organization that creates them
