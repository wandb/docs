There are several ways to manage experiments.

For complex workflows, use multiple runs and set the group parameters in [`wandb.init`]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/launch.md" >}}) to a unique value for all processes within a single experiment. The [**Runs** tab]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/project-page.md#runs-tab" >}}) will group the table by group ID, ensuring that visualizations function properly. This approach enables concurrent experiments and training runs while logging results in one location.

For simpler workflows, call `wandb.init` with `resume=True` and `id=UNIQUE_ID`, then call `wandb.init` again with the same `id=UNIQUE_ID`. Log normally with [`wandb.log`]({{< relref "/guides/models/track/log/" >}}) or `wandb.summary`, and the run values will update accordingly.
