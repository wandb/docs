The W&B client library supported both Python 2.7 and Python 3 through version 0.10. Support for Python 2.7 discontinued with version 0.11 due to Python 2's end of life. Running `pip install --upgrade wandb` on a Python 2.7 system installs only new releases of the 0.10.x series. Support for the 0.10.x series includes critical bug fixes and patches only. The last version of the 0.10.x series that supports Python 2.7 is 0.10.33.
