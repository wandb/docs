W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML]({{< relref path="/guides/core/artifacts/" lang="ja" >}}) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations]({{< relref path="/guides/models/tables/" lang="ja" >}}).
- [Document and share]({{< relref path="/guides/core/reports/" lang="ja" >}}) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data]({{< relref path="/guides/models/app/features/panels/query-panels/" lang="ja" >}}) that serve your custom needs.
- Configure custom automations that trigger key workflows for [model CI/CD]({{< relref path="/guides/core/automations/model-registry-automations.md" lang="ja" >}}).
