A registry admin can [configure registry roles]({{< relref path="configure_registry.md#configure-registry-roles" lang="ja" >}}), [add users]({{< relref path="configure_registry.md#add-a-user-or-a-team-to-a-registry" lang="ja" >}}), or [remove users]({{< relref path="configure_registry.md#remove-a-user-or-team-from-a-registry" lang="ja" >}}) from a registry by configuring the registry's settings.

Removing a user from a team also removes that user's access to the registry.

## Registry roles

Each user in a registry has a *registry role*, which determines what they can do in that registry. 

W&B automatically assigns a default registry role to a user or team when they are added to a registry. 

| Entity | Default registry role |
| ----- | ----- |
| Team | Viewer |
| User (non admin) | Viewer |
| Org admin | Admin |


A registry admin can assign or modify roles for users and teams in a registry.
See [Configure user roles in a registry]({{< relref path="configure_registry.md#configure-registry-roles" lang="ja" >}}) for more information.

{{% alert title="W&B role types" %}}
There are two different types of roles in W&B: [Team roles]({{< ref "/guides/models/app/settings-page/teams.md#team-role-and-permissions" >}}) and [Registry roles]({{< relref path="configure_registry.md#configure-registry-roles" lang="ja" >}}).

Your role in a team has no impact or relationship to your role in any registry.

The proceeding table lists the different roles a user can have and their permissions:

### Inherited permissions

A user's permission in a registry depends on the highest level of privilege assigned to that user, whether individually or by team membership.

For example, suppose a registry admin adds a user called Nico to Registry A and assigns them a **Viewer** registry role. A registry admin then adds a team called Foundation Model Team to Registry A and assigns Foundation Model Team a **Member** registry role.

Nico is a member of the Foundation Model Team, which is a **Member** of the Registry. Because **Member** has more permission than **Viewer**, W&B grants Nico the **Member** role.

The proceeding table demonstrates the highest level of permission in the event of a conflict between a user's individual registry role and the registry role of a team they are a member of:

| Team registry role | Individual registry role | Inherited registry role |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Viewer | Viewer | Viewer |
| Member | Viewer | Member |
| Admin  | Viewer | Admin  | 

If there is a conflict, W&B displays the highest level of permissions next to the name of the user.

For example, in the proceeding image Alex inherits **Member** role privileges because they are a member of the `smle-reg-team-1` team.
