W&B Models is the system of record for ML Practitioners who want to organize their models, boost productivity and collaboration, and deliver production ML at scale. 

{{< img src="/images/general/architecture.png" alt="" >}}

With W&B Models, you can: 

- Track and visualize all [ML experiments]({{< relref path="/guides/models/track/" lang="ja" >}}).
- Optimize and fine-tune models at scale with [hyperparameter sweeps]({{< relref path="/guides/models/sweeps/" lang="ja" >}}).
- [Maintain a centralized hub of all models]({{< relref path="/guides/core/registry/" lang="ja" >}}), with a seamless handoff point to devops and deployment teams.
- Configure custom automations that trigger key workflows for [model CI/CD]({{< relref path="/guides/core/automations/model-registry-automations.md" lang="ja" >}}).

Machine learning practitioners rely on W&B Models as their ML system of record to track and visualize experiments, manage model versions and lineage, and optimize hyperparameters.
