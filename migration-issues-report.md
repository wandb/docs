# Mintlify Migration Issues Report

## Summary

During investigation of the missing `models_quickstart` page, I discovered an issue with the migration script's file mapping logic.

## Specific Issue: models_quickstart.mdx

**Original Issue:** The page https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/models_quickstart/ was reported as missing.

**Finding:** The file exists but was incorrectly placed at `models/models_quickstart.mdx` instead of `guides/models_quickstart.mdx`.

**Root Cause:** The migration script incorrectly mapped `content/en/guides/models_quickstart.md` to `models/models_quickstart.mdx` when it should have gone to `guides/models_quickstart.mdx` (as confirmed by checking the mintlifytest repo).

**Status:** Fixed in commit cdd862f1d

## Context on Japanese/Korean Content

After further investigation, I learned that:
- The migration involved significant information architecture changes (guides → models, ref/release-notes → release-notes, etc.)
- Japanese and Korean content that hasn't been translated yet legitimately starts as English content in `ja/` and `ko/` directories
- The 461 files in `ja/` and `ko/` directories with English content are likely intentional placeholders awaiting translation

## The Real Issue

The migration script had a specific bug where it incorrectly mapped:
- `content/en/guides/models_quickstart.md` → `models/models_quickstart.mdx` (WRONG)
- Should have been → `guides/models_quickstart.mdx` (CORRECT, as per mintlifytest repo)

This appears to be an isolated issue rather than a systemic problem. The script correctly handled most files but missed this specific case.

## Verification Needed

To ensure this is truly an isolated issue, we should:
1. Compare the final structure in wandb/docs with the intended structure in wandb/mintlifytest
2. Check if there are other files that ended up in `models/` that should be in `guides/`
3. Verify the navigation configuration matches the actual file locations

## Files Already Fixed
- `guides/models_quickstart.mdx` - moved from incorrect location at `models/models_quickstart.mdx`
