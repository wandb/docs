Regarding W&B specifics, we have a list of product names and technical words that are always associated to the product and *never* to be translated. Keep them in english.
- Artifacts
- Entities
- Projects
- Runs
- Experiments
- Datasets
- Reports
- Sweeps
- Weave
- Launch
- Models
- Projects
- Teams
- Users
- Workspace
- Registered Models
and more...

These words appear often on lists like this:

1. [**word**](link/target.md): Something about wandb
2. [**word2**](link/target2.md): Something about wandb again
etc...

Never translate them in this context.

Here is a chunk of documentation in docusaurus Markdown format to translate. 

```markdown
{md_chunk}
```

Return the translation only in markdown format, without adding anything else. Do not add the ```markdown``` tags or any backticks.
