# Translation Configuration files

These configs files are used to generate the translation of our docs to japanese/korean and more!


## gpt_translate

We use the Library [gpt_translate](https://github.com/tcapelle/gpt_translate) that is powered by GPT models to generate the docs.

## Dictionaries

We keep a list of dictionaries that improves the translation consistency. These are injected into the system prompt so the technical and corporate terms ares translated (or not!) correctly.
