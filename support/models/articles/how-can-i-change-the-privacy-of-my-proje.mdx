To change a project's privacy (visibility):

1. In the W&B App, from any page in the project, click **Overview** in the project sidebar.
1. At the top right, click **Edit**.
1. Choose a new value for **Project visibility**:

    - **Team** (default): Only your team can view and edit the project.
    - **Restricted**: Only invited members can access the project, and public access is turned off.
    - **Open**: Anyone can submit runs or create reports, but only your team can edit it. Appropriate only for classroom settings, public benchmark competitions, or other non-durable contexts.
    - **Public**: Anyone can view the project, but only your team can edit it.

        <Note>
        If your W&B admins have turned off **Public** visibility, you cannot choose it. Instead, you can share a view-only [W&B Report](/models/reports/collaborate-on-reports#share-a-report), or contact your W&B organization's admins for assistance.
        </Note>
1. Click **Save**.
    
If you update a project to a more strict privacy setting, you may need to re-invite individual users to restore their ability to access the project.
