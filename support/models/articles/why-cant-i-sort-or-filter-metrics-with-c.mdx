Metric names in W&B must follow GraphQL naming conventions to ensure they can be properly sorted and filtered in the UI.

## Valid metric names

* **Allowed characters**: Letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_)
* **Starting character**: Names must start with a letter or underscore
* **Pattern**: Metric names should match `/^[_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*$/`

Metrics that don't follow these rules may not be sortable or filterable in the W&B UI.

## Examples

**Valid metric names:**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "val_loss": 0.1, "epoch_5": 5})
  run.log({"modelAccuracy": 0.95, "learning_rate": 0.001})
```

**Invalid metric names (avoid these):**
```python
with wandb.init() as run:
  run.log({"acc,val": 0.9})  # Contains comma
  run.log({"loss-train": 0.1})  # Contains hyphen
  run.log({"test acc": 0.95})  # Contains space
  run.log({"5_fold_cv": 0.8})  # Starts with number
```


## Recommended solution

Replace invalid characters with valid characters such as underscores:
- Instead of `"test acc"`, use `"test_acc"`
- Instead of `"loss-train"`, use `"loss_train"`
- Instead of `"acc,val"`, use `"acc_val"`
