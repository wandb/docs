To regain access to an account when unable to receive a password reset email:

1. **Check Spam or Junk Folders:** Ensure the email is not filtered there.
2. **Verify Email:** Confirm the correct email associated with the account.
3. **Check for SSO Options:** Use services like "Sign in with Google" if available.
4. **Contact Support:** If issues persist, reach out to support (support@wandb.com) and provide your username and email for assistance.
