By default, artifacts download to the `artifacts/` folder. To change the location:

- Pass it to [`wandb.Artifact().download`](/models/ref/python/public-api/api):

    ```python
    wandb.Artifact().download(root="<path_to_download>")
    ```

- Set the `WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR` [environment variable](/models/track/environment-variables):

    ```python
    import os
    os.environ["WANDB_ARTIFACT_DIR"] = "<path_to_download>"
    ```
