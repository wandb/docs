These examples show logging losses a couple of different ways using [`wandb.Run.log()`](/models/ref/python/experiments/run/#method-runlog/).

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Using a dictionary">
```python
import wandb

# Initialize a new run
with wandb.init(project="log-list-values", name="log-dict") as run:
    # Log losses as a dictionary
    losses = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
    run.log({"losses": losses})
    run.log({f"losses/loss-{ii}": loss for ii, loss in enumerate(losses)})
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="As a histogram">
```python
import wandb

# Initialize a new run
with wandb.init(project="log-list-values", name="log-hist") as run:
    # Log losses as a histogram
    losses = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
    run.log({"losses": wandb.Histogram(losses)})
```
</Tab>
