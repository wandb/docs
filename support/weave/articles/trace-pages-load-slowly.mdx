If trace pages are loading slowly, reduce the number of rows displayed to improve load time. The default value is `50`. You can either reduce the number of rows via the UI, or using query parameters.

### Adjust via the UI (recommended)

Use the **Per page** control at the bottom-right of the Traces page to adjust the number of rows displayed. In addition to the default of `50`, you can also set to `10`, `25`, or `100`.

### Use query parameters

If you prefer a manual approach, you can modify the `pageSize` query parameter in your query URL to a value less than the maximum of `100`.
