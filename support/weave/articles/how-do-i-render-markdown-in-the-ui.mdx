Wrap your string with `weave.Markdown(...)` before saving, and use `weave.publish(...)` to store it. Weave uses the object’s type to determine rendering, and `weave.Markdown` maps to a known UI renderer.  The value will be shown as a formatted Markdown object in the UI. For a full code sample, see [Viewing calls](/weave/guides/tracking/tracing#viewing-calls).
