Sometimes, large trace data is partially cut off in the Weave UI. This problem occurs because default trace output is a raw, custom Python object that Weave doesn't know how to serialize.

To ensure that large trace data isn't cut off, define a dictionary of strings to return all trace data.

```python
import weave

class MyObj:
    def __init__(self, x: int):
        self.x = x

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"MyObj(x={self.x})"

    def to_dict(self):
        return {"x": self.x}

@weave.op()
def make_my_obj():
    x = "s" * 10_000
    return MyObj(x)
```
