We define ingested bytes as bytes that we receive, process, and store on your behalf. This includes trace metadata, LLM inputs/outputs, and any other information you explicitly log to Weave, but does not include communication overhead (e.g., HTTP headers) or any other data that is not placed in long-term storage. We count bytes as "ingested" only once at the time they are received and stored.
