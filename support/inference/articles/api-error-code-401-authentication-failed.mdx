A 401 error with the message "Authentication failed" means your authentication credentials are incorrect or your W&B project entity and/or name are incorrect.

## Why this happens

The W&B Inference API requires valid authentication credentials to process requests. This error occurs when:

- Your API key is invalid, expired, or revoked
- Your W&B project entity name is incorrect
- Your W&B project name is incorrect

## What you can do

1. **Verify your API key**
   - Check that you're using the correct API key for your account
   - Regenerate your API key if needed from your [W&B settings](https://wandb.ai/settings)

2. **Check your project details**
   - Ensure your W&B project entity (organization or username) is correct
   - Verify that the project name matches an existing project

3. **Contact support**
   - If the issue persists after verifying your credentials, reach out to [W&B support](mailto:support@wandb.com)
