A 429 error with the message "Concurrency limit reached for requests" means you're sending too many concurrent requests to the W&B Inference API.

## Why this happens

W&B Inference enforces concurrency limits to ensure fair usage and service stability. When the number of simultaneous requests from your account exceeds the allowed limit, additional requests are rejected with a 429 status code.

## What you can do

1. **Reduce concurrent requests**
   - Implement request queuing or throttling in your application
   - Use exponential backoff when retrying failed requests

2. **Increase your limits**
   - Review your plan's concurrency limits and upgrade if needed

For more information, see [Usage information and limits](/inference/usage-limits/).
