A 503 error with the message "The engine is currently overloaded, please try again later" means the W&B Inference server is experiencing high traffic and cannot process your request right now.

## Why this happens

During periods of high demand, the inference engine may become temporarily overloaded. This is a transient condition that typically resolves on its own as traffic subsides.

## What you can do

1. **Retry after a short delay**
   - Wait a few seconds before retrying your request
   - Use exponential backoff to avoid adding to the congestion

2. **Spread out requests**
   - If you're sending many requests, consider spacing them out over time
   - Implement request queuing to smooth traffic spikes
