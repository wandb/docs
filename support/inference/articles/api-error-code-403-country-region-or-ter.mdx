A 403 error with the message "Country, region, or territory not supported" means you're accessing W&B Inference from an unsupported location.

## What you can do

1. **Check the geographic restrictions**
   - Review the [geographic restrictions](/inference/usage-limits/#geographic-restrictions) for the current list of supported locations

2. **Use from a supported location**
   - Access the service when in a supported country or region
   - Consider using your organization's resources in supported locations

3. **Contact your account team**
   - Enterprise customers can discuss options with their account executive
   - Some organizations may have special arrangements

## Error details

When you see this error:
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "Country, region, or territory not supported"
