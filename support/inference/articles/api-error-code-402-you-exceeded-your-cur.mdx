A 402 error with the message "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details" means you've run out of credits or reached your monthly spending cap.

## Why this happens

W&B Inference uses a credit-based system. This error occurs when:

- Your account has no remaining credits
- You've reached the monthly spending cap set for your organization

## What you can do

1. **Check your plan and billing details**
   - Review your current usage and remaining credits in your W&B account settings

2. **Get more credits**
   - Purchase additional credits or upgrade your plan

3. **Increase your limits**
   - Adjust your monthly spending cap if one is configured

For more information, see [Usage information and limits](/inference/usage-limits/).
