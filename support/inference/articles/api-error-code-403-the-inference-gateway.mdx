A 403 error with the message "The inference gateway is not enabled for your organization" means your organization doesn't have the inference gateway enabled, which is required to use W&B Inference.

## Why this happens

W&B Inference requires the inference gateway to be enabled at the organization level. If your organization hasn't enabled this feature, all API requests will be rejected with a 403 error.

## What you can do

1. **Contact your W&B administrator**
   - Ask your organization's W&B administrator to enable the inference gateway

2. **Reach out to W&B support**
   - If you're unsure who your administrator is, or need help enabling the gateway, contact [W&B support](mailto:support@wandb.com) for assistance
