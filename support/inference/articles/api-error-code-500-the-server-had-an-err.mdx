A 500 error with the message "The server had an error while processing your request" indicates an internal server error on the W&B Inference side.

## Why this happens

Internal server errors are typically transient issues caused by temporary problems on the server side. These are not caused by your request or configuration.

## What you can do

1. **Retry after a brief wait**
   - Wait a few seconds and retry your request
   - Use exponential backoff for automated retries

2. **Contact support if it persists**
   - If you continue to see 500 errors after multiple retries, contact [W&B support](mailto:support@wandb.com) with details about your request
