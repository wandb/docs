# Python SDK Reference Documentation Issue

## Problem Summary

The Python SDK reference documentation reorganization from commit f96e08c30 (September 17, 2025) was not properly reflected in the Mintlify migration, even though the commit is technically in the branch history.

## What Happened

1. **September 17**: Noah Luna's PR #1656 reorganized the Python SDK reference docs:
   - Changed file naming from lowercase to uppercase (e.g., `artifacts.md` → `Artifacts.md`, added new files like `ArtifactCollection.md`)
   - Restructured the documentation hierarchy
   - Added new Public API class pages
   - Renamed directories and improved organization

2. **September 19**: Vendor's cutoff at commit 6b0cdad0b

3. **Migration Issue**: The migration script processed the OLD file structure (lowercase names) instead of the NEW structure (uppercase names) because:
   - The Lazydocs changes created NEW files with uppercase names
   - The migration script appears to have renamed the OLD lowercase files to `.mdx`
   - The NEW uppercase files were never migrated to the Mintlify structure

## Current State

### What we have (incorrect):
```
models/ref/python/public-api/
├── api.mdx (old structure)
├── artifacts.mdx (old structure)
├── artifactcollection.mdx (should be ArtifactCollection.mdx)
├── runs.mdx (old combined file)
└── ... (lowercase, old structure)
```

### What we should have:
```
models/ref/python/public-api/
├── Api.mdx
├── Artifact.mdx (individual class)
├── ArtifactCollection.mdx (individual class)
├── ArtifactCollections.mdx (collection class)
├── Run.mdx (individual class page)
├── Registry.mdx (new)
├── BetaReport.mdx (new)
└── ... (uppercase, new structure)
```

## Impact

- Missing new documentation pages (Registry, BetaReport, Member, etc.)
- Old combined pages instead of individual class pages
- Incorrect file naming convention (lowercase vs uppercase)
- Missing properties and return types documentation
- Missing admonitions and improved structure

## Files Affected

From commit f96e08c30, approximately 66 files were changed:
- 171 files changed
- 3,904 insertions
- 2,214 deletions

Key changes included:
- New files: BetaReport.md, Member.md, Project.md, Registry.md, Run.md, RunArtifacts.md, Sweep.md
- Renamed: teams.md → Team.md, users.md → User.md
- Major refactoring of: artifacts.md, projects.md, reports.md, runs.md, sweeps.md

## Recommended Fix

The Python SDK reference documentation needs to be re-migrated properly:

1. Check out the state after commit f96e08c30
2. Apply the proper Mintlify migration to those files
3. Move them to the correct location under `models/ref/python/`
4. Ensure uppercase naming is preserved
5. Update any navigation references

This is a significant documentation regression that affects the entire Python SDK reference section.
