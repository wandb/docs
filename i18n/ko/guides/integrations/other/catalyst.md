# Catalyst

> [Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) is a PyTorch framework for deep learning R&D that focuses on reproducibility, rapid experimentation, and codebase reuse so you can create something new.

Catalyst has an awesome W&B integration for logging parameters, metrics, images, and other artifacts.

Check out their documentation of the integration [here](https://catalyst-team.github.io/catalyst/api/loggers.html#catalyst.loggers.wandb.WandbLogger), including examples using Python and Hydra.

## Interactive Example

Run this [example colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PD0LnXiADCtt4mu7bzv7VfQkFXVrPxJq?usp=sharing) to see Catalyst and W&B integration in action.
