# W&B Server

Deploy W&B in a resource isolated environment managed by W&B or by yourself. W&B Server is shipped as a packaged Docker image that can be deployed easily into any underlying infrastructure. There are several ways to install and host the W&B Server in different environments.

:::info
Production-grade features for W&B Server are available for enterprise-tier only.

See the [Basic Setup guide](./how-to-guides/basic-setup.md) to set up a developer or trial environment.
:::

With W&B Server you can configure and leverage features such as:

- [Secure Storage Connector](./secure-storage-connector.md)
- [Single Sign-On](./sso.md)
- [Role-based Access Control via LDAP](./ldap.md)
- [Audit Logs](./audit-logging.md)
- [User Management](./manage-users.md)
- [Prometheus Monitoring](./prometheus-logging.md)
- [Slack Alerts](./slack-alerts.md)
- [Garbage Collect Deleted Artifacts](../artifacts/delete-artifacts.md#how-to-enable-garbage-collection-based-on-how-you-host-wb)

The following sections of the documentation describes different options on how to install W&B Server, the shared responsibility model, step-by-step installation and configuration guides.

## Recommendations

W&B recommends the following when configuring W&B Server:

1. Run the W&B Server Docker container with an external storage and an external MySQL database in order to preserve the state outside of a container. This protects the data from being accidentally deleted if the container dies or crashes.
2. Leverage Kubernetes to run the W&B Server Docker image and expose the `wandb` service.
3. Set up and manage a scale-able file system if you plan on using W&B Server for production-related work.

## System Requirements

W&B Server requires a machine with at least

- 4 cores of CPU &
- 8GB of memory (RAM)

Your W&B data will be saved on a persistent volume or external database, ensuring that it is preserved across different versions of the container.

:::tip
For enterprise customers, W&B offers extensive technical support and frequent installation updates for privately hosted instances.
