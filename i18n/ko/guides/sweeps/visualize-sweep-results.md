  <title>Visualize Results of W&B Sweeps</title>

Visualize the results of your W&B Sweeps with the W&B App UI. Navigate to the W&B App UI at [https://wandb.ai/home](https://wandb.ai/home). Choose the project that you specified when you initialized a W&B Sweep. You will be redirected to your project [workspace](../app/pages/workspaces.md). Select the **Sweep icon** on the left panel (broom icon). From the [Sweep UI](./visualize-sweep-results.md), select the name of your Sweep from the list.

By default, W&B will automatically create a parallel coordinates plot, a parameter importance plot, and a scatter plot when you start a W&B Sweep job.

Parallel coordinates charts summarize the relationship between large numbers of hyperparameters and model metrics at a glance. For more information on parallel coordinates plots, see [Parallel coordinates](../app/features/panels/parallel-coordinates.md).

The scatter plot(left) compares the W&B Runs that were generated during the Sweep. For more information about scatter plots, see [Scatter Plots](../app/features/panels/scatter-plot.md).

The parameter importance plot(right) lists the hyperparameters that were the best predictors of, and highly correlated to desirable values of your metrics. For more information parameter importance plots, see [Parameter Importance](../app/features/panels/parameter-importance.md).

You can alter the dependent and independent values (x and y axis) that are automatically used. Within each panel there is a pencil icon called **Edit panel**. Choose **Edit panel**. A model will appear. Within the modal, you can alter the behavior of the graph.

For more information on all default W&B visualization options, see [Panels](../app/features/panels/intro.md). See the [Data Visualization docs](../tables/intro.md) for information on how to create plots from W&B Runs that are not part of a W&B Sweep.
