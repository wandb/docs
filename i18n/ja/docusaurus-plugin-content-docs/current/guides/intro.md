# What is Weights & Biases?

Weights & Biases is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.
Set up W&B in 5 minutes, then quickly iterate on your machine learning pipeline with the confidence that your datasets and models are tracked and versioned in a reliable system of record.

## Are you a first-time user of W&B?
If this is your first time using W&B we suggest you explore the following:

1. Experience Weights & Biases in action, [run an example introduction project with Google Colab](http://wandb.me/intro).
1. Read through the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) for a quick overview of how and where to add W&B to your code.
2. Read [How does Weights & Biases work?](#how-does-weights--biases-work) This section provides an overview of the building blocks of W&B.
3. Explore our [Integrations guide](./integrations/intro.md) and our [W&B Easy Integration YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkjwWybwh8g&list=PLD80i8An1OEGDADxOBaH71ZwieZ9nmPGC&index=3&ab_channel=Weights%26Biases) playlist for information on how to integrate W&B with your preferred machine learning framework.
4. View the [API Reference guide](../ref/README.md) for technical specifications about the W&B Python Library, CLI, and Weave operations.


## How does Weights & Biases work?
We recommend you read the following sections in this order if you are a first-time user of W&B:

1. Learn about [Runs](./runs/intro.md), W&B's basic unit of computation. 
2. Create and track machine learning experiments with [Experiments](./track/intro.md).
3. Discover W&B's flexible and lightweight building block for dataset and model versioning with [Artifacts](./artifacts/intro.md).
4. Automate hyperparameter search and explore the space of possible models with [Sweeps](./sweeps/intro.md).
5. Learn how to track dependencies and results across machine learning pipelines with our [data and model versioning](./data-and-model-versioning/intro.md) guide.
6. Manage the model lifecycle from training to production with [Model Management](./models/intro.md).
7. Visualize predictions across model versions with our [Data Visualization](./data-vis/intro.md) guide.
8. Organize W&B Runs, embed and automate visualizations, describe your findings, and share updates with collaborators with [Reports](./reports/intro.md).
