# Walkthrough

This guide will walk you through how to setup the fundamental components of W&B launch:  **launch jobs**, **launch queues**, and **launch agents**. By the end of this walkthrough, you will:

1. Create a launch job that trains a neural network.
2. Create a launch queue that is used to submit jobs for execution on your local machine.
3. Create a launch agent that polls the queue and starts your launch job with Docker.

:::note
The walkthrough outlined on this page is designed to run on your local machine with Docker.  
:::

## Before you get started

Before you get started, ensure you have satisfied the following prerequisites:
1. Install W&B Python SDK version 0.14.0 or higher:
    ```bash
    pip install wandb>=0.14.0
    ```
2. Sign up for a free account at https://wandb.ai/site and then login to your wandb account. 
3. Install Docker. See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for more information on how to install Docker. Make sure the docker daemon is running on your machine.

## Create a launch job

[Launch jobs](./launch-terminology#launch-job) are the basic unit of work in W&B launch. The following code creates a launch job from a W&B [run](../../ref/python/run.md) using the W&B Python SDK.

1. Copy the following Python code to a file named `train.py`. Save the file on your local machine. Replace `<your entity>` with your W&B entity.

    ```python title="train.py"
    import wandb

    config = {
        "epochs": 10
    }

    entity = "<your entity>"
    project = "launch-quickstart"
    job_name = "walkthrough_example"

    with wandb.init(entity=entity, config=config, project=project, job_name=job_name) as run:
        config = wandb.config
        for epoch in range(1, config.epochs):
            loss = config.epochs / epoch
            accuracy = (1 + (epoch / config.epochs))/2
            wandb.log({
                "loss": loss, 
                "accuracy": accuracy, 
                "epoch": epoch})
        
        # highlight-next-line
        wandb.run.log_code()  
    ```

2. Execute the Python script and let the script run until it completes:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

This will create a launch job.  In the above example, the launch job was created in a `launch-quickstart` project.

Next, we will add the newly created launch job to a *launch queue*.

:::tip
There are numerous ways to create a launch job. See the [Create a launch job](./create-launch-job.md) page to learn more about the different ways you can create a launch job,.
:::

## Add your launch job to a queue
Once you have created a launch job, add that job to a [launch queue](./launch-terminology.md#launch-queue). The following steps describe how to create a basic launch queue that will use a Docker container as its [target resource](./launch-terminology.md#target-resources):
<!-- ![](/images/launch/simple-job.png) -->

1. Navigate to your W&B project. 
2. Select the Jobs tab on the left panel (thunderbolt icon).
3. Hover your mouse next the name of the job you created and select the **Launch** button.
4. A drawer will slide from the right side of your screen. Select the following:
    1. **Job version**: the version of the job to launch.  Since we only have one version, select the default **@latest** version.
    2. **Overrides**: new values for the launch job's inputs. Our run had one value in the `wandb.config`: `epochs`. We can override this value within the overrides field. For this walkthrough, leave the number of epochs as is.
    3. **Queue**: the queue to launch the run on. From the dropdown, select **Create a 'Starter' queue**.

5. Once you have configured your job, click the **Launch now** button at the bottom of the drawer to enqueue your launch job.


:::tip
The contents of your launch queue configuration will vary depending on the queue's target resource.

## Start a launch agent
To execute a launch job you will need a [launch agent](./launch-terminology.md#launch-agent) to poll the launch queue the job was added to. Follow these steps to create and start a launch agent:

1. From [wandb.ai/launch](https://wandb.ai/launch) navigate to the page for your launch queue.
2. Click the **Add agent** button.
3. A modal will appear with a W&B CLI command. Copy this and paste this command into your terminal.

![](/images/launch/activate_starter_queue_agent.png)

In general, the command to start a launch agent is:

```bash
wandb launch-agent -e <entity-name> -q <queue-name>
```

Within your terminal, you will see the agent begin to poll for queues. Wait a few seconds to a minute and you will see your agent execute the launch job you added to it.

:::tip
Launch agents can poll for queues in non-local environments such as a Kubernetes cluster.
:::


## View your launch job

Navigate to your new **launch-quickstart** project in your W&B account and open the jobs tab from the navigation on the left side of the screen.

![](/images/launch/jobs-tab.png)

The **Jobs** page displays a list of W&B Jobs that were created from previously executed runs. You should see a job named **job-source-launch-quickstart-train.py:v0**. Click on your launch job to view source code dependencies and a list of runs that were created by the launch job.

:::tip
You can edit the name of the job from the jobs page if you would like to make the job a bit more memorable.
