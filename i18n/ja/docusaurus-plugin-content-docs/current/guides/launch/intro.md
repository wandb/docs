Beta product in active development

Interested in Launch? Reach out to your account team to talk about joining the customer pilot program for W&B Launch.

Pilot customers need to use AWS EKS or SageMaker to qualify for the beta program. We plan to support additional platforms.
:::

Connect your own SageMaker or Kubernetes cluster, then easily queue and manage jobs using W&B Launch. Kick off jobs on your own infrastructure from the W&B UI or CLI. Applications to the Launch pilot program are open to paying customers at the moment. To get started with W&B for your company, talk to Sales here: [https://wandb.ai/site/pricing](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing)

With W&B Launch you can:

* Execute runs in reproducible containerized environments
* Queue and launch jobs across your own clusters, locally or in the cloud
* Easily tweak hyperparameters or input data and retrain models
* Automatically trigger evaluation jobs on newly trained models
