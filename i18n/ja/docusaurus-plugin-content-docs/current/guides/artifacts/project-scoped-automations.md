# Artifact automations

<!-- change description to: Use an Automation on artifacts in your project to trigger actions when aliases or versions in an artifact collection are created or changed. For example, you can trigger a launch job whenever a new version is added to a dataset artifact to automatically retrain a model. -->

Create an automation on artifacts to trigger actions when aliases or versions in an artifact collection are created or changed. For example, you can trigger a launch job whenever a new version is added to a dataset artifact to automatically retrain a model. Artifact automations have project-level scope.


To create an automation, define the [action](#action-types) you want to occur based on an [event type](#event-types). For example, you can create a trigger that automatically retrains a model when a dataset is updated. 

The following page describes how to create, view, and delete automations that apply to artifacts in a project.

:::tip
Consider project-scoped automations (artifact automations) when you want to automate downstream actions for versioning artifacts that are not of type "model".
:::

:::info
Artifact automations are project-scope. This means that only events within a project will trigger an artifact automation.

This is in contrast to automations created in the W&B Model Registry. Automations created in the model registry have Model Registry scope; they are triggered when events are performed on model versions linked to the [Model Registry](../model_registry/intro.md). For information on how to create an automations for models versions, see the [Automations for Model CI/CD](../model_registry/automation.md) page in the [Model Registry chapter](../model_registry/intro.md).
:::


## Event types
An *event* is a change that takes place in the W&B ecosystem. For automations that apply to artifacts in a project, the event types are for changes applied to an artifact collection. 

You can define two different event types for artifact collections in your project: **A new version of an artifact is added in a collection** and **An artifact alias is created**.

:::tip
Use the **A new version of an artifact is added in a collection** event type for applying recurring actions to each version of an artifact. For example, you can create an automation that automatically starts a training job when a new dataset artifact version is created.

Use the **An artifact alias is added** event type to create an automation that activates when a specific alias is applied to an artifact version. For example, you could create an automation that triggers an action when someone adds "test-set-quality-check" alias to an artifact that then triggers downstream processing on that dataset. 
:::



## Action types
An action is a responsive mutation (internal or external) that occurs as a result of some trigger. There are two types of actions you can create in response to events on artifact collections in your project: webhooks and [W&B Launch Jobs](../launch/intro.md).

* Webhooks: Communicate with an external web server from W&B with HTTP requests.
* W&B Launch job: [Jobs](../launch/create-launch-job.md) are reusable, configurable run templates that allow you to quickly launch new [runs](../runs/intro.md) locally on your desktop or external compute resources such as Kubernetes on EKS, Amazon SageMaker, and more. 


The following sections describe how to create an automation with webhooks and W&B Launch.

## Create a webhook automation 
Automate a webhook based on an action with the W&B App UI. To do this, you will first establish a webhook, then you will configure the webhook automation. 

### Add a secret for authentication
Define a team secret to ensure the authenticity and integrity of data transmitted from payloads. 

:::note
* Secrets are available if you use:
  * W&B SaaS public cloud; or
  * W&B Server in a Kubernetes cluster
* Skip this section if the external server you send HTTP POST requests to does not use secrets.  
:::


1. Navigate to the W&B App UI.
2. Click on **Team Settings**.
3. Scroll down the page until you find the **Team secrets** section.
4. Click on the **New secret** button.
5. A modal will appear. Provide a name for your secret in the **Secret name** field.
6. Add your secret into the **Secret** field. 

:::info
Only W&B Admins can create, edit, or delete a secret.
:::

Once you create a secret, you can access that secret in your W&B workflows with `$`.

### Configure a webhook
Before you can use a webhook, you will first need to configure that webhook in the W&B App UI.

:::info
Only W&B Admins can configure a webhook for a W&B Team.
:::

1. Navigate to the W&B App UI.
2. Click on **Team Settings**.
4. Scroll down the page until you find the **Webhooks** section.
5. Click on the **New webhook** button.  
6. Provide a name for your webhook in the **Name** field.
7. Provide the endpoint URL for the webhook in the **URL** field.


### Add a webhook 
Once you have a webhook configured and (optionally) a secret, navigate to your project workspace. Click on the **Automations** tab on the left sidebar.

1. From the **Event type** dropdown, select an [event type](#event-types).
![](/images/artifacts/artifact_webhook_select_event.png)
2. (Optional) If you selected **A new version of an artifact is created in a collection** event, provide the name of the artifact collection that the automation should respond to from the **Artifact collection** dropdown. 
![](/images/artifacts/webhook_new_version_artifact.png)
3. Select **Webhooks** from the **Action type** dropdown. 
4. Click on the **Next step** button.
5. Select a webhook from the **Webhook** dropdown.
![](/images/artifacts/artifacts_webhooks_select_from_dropdown.png)
6. (Optional) Provide a payload in the JSON expression editor. See the [Example payload](#example-payloads) section for common use case examples.
7. Click on **Next step**.
8. Provide a name for your webhook automation in the **Automation name** field. 
![](/images/artifacts/artifacts_webhook_name_automation.png)
9. (Optional) Provide a description for your webhook. 
10. Click on the **Create automation** button.

### Example payloads

The following tabs demonstrate example payloads based on common use cases. Within the examples they reference the following keys to refer to condition objects in the payload parameters:
* `${event_type}` Refers to the type of event that triggered the action.
* `${event_author}` Refers to the user that triggered the action.
* `${artifact_version}` Refers to the specific artifact version that triggered the action. Passed as an artifact instance.
* `${artifact_version_string}` Refers to the specific artifact version that triggered the action. Passed as a string.
* `${artifact_collection_name}` Refers to the name of the artifact collection that the artifact version is linked to.
* `${project_name}` Refers to the name of the project owning the mutation that triggered the action.
* `${entity_name}` Refers to the name of the entity owning the mutation that triggered the action.


<Tabs
  defaultValue="github"
  values={[
    {label: 'GitHub repository dispatch', value: 'github'},
    {label: 'Microsoft Teams notification', value: 'microsoft'},
    {label: 'Slack notifications', value: 'slack'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="github">

  
  Send a repository dispatch from W&B to trigger a GitHub action. For example, suppose you have workflow that accepts a repository dispatch as a trigger for the `on` key:

  ```yaml
  on:
    repository_dispatch:
      types: ADD_ARTIFACT_ALIAS
  ```

  The payload for the repository might look something like:

  ```json
  {
    "event_type": "${event_type}",
    "client_payload": 
    {
      "event_author": "${event_author}",
      "artifact_version": "${artifact_version}",
      "artifact_version_string": "${artifact_version_string}",
      "artifact_collection_name": "${artifact_collection_name}",
      "project_name": "${project_name}",
      "entity_name": "${entity_name}"
      }
  }

  ```

  Where template strings render depending on the event or artifact version the automation is configured for. `${event_type}` will render as an "LINK_ARTIFACT" or "ADD_ARTIFACT_ALIAS". See below for an example mapping:

  ```json
  ${event_type} --> "LINK_ARTIFACT" or "ADD_ARTIFACT_ALIAS"
  ${event_author} --> "<wandb-user>"
  ${artifact_version} --> "wandb-artifact://_id/QXJ0aWZhY3Q6NTE3ODg5ODg3""
  ${artifact_version_string} --> "<entity>/<project_name>/<artifact_name>:<alias>"
  ${artifact_collection_name} --> "<artifact_collection_name>"
  ${project_name} --> "<project_name>"
  ${entity_name} --> "<entity>"
  ```

  Use template strings to dynamically pass context from W&B to GitHub Actions and other tools. If those tools can call Python scripts, they can consume W&B artifacts through the [W&B API](../artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact.md).

  For more information about repository dispatch, see the [official documentation on the GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/repository-dispatch).

  <TabItem value="microsoft">

  Configure an â€˜Incoming Webhook' to get the webhook URL for your Teams Channel by configuring. The following is an example payload:
  
  ```json 
  {
  "@type": "MessageCard",
  "@context": "http://schema.org/extensions",
  "summary": "New Notification",
  "sections": [
    {
      "activityTitle": "Notification from WANDB",
      "text": "This is an example message sent via Teams webhook.",
      "facts": [
        {
          "name": "Author",
          "value": "${event_author}"
        },
        {
          "name": "Event Type",
          "value": "${event_type}"
        }
      ],
      "markdown": true
    }
  ]
  }
  ```
  You can use template strings to inject W&B data into your payload at the time of execution (as shown in the Teams example above).


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="slack">

  Setup your Slack app and add an incoming webhook integration with the instructions highlighted in the [Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). Ensure that you have the secret specified under `Bot User OAuth Toke`n as your W&B webhookâ€™s access token. 
  
  The following is an example payload:

  ```json
    {
        "text": "New alert from WANDB!",
    "blocks": [
        {
                "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "Artifact event: ${event_type}"
            }
        },
            {
                "type":"section",
                "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "New version: ${artifact_version_string}"
            }
            },
            {
            "type": "divider"
        },
            {
                "type": "section",
            "text": {
                "type": "mrkdwn",
                "text": "Author: ${event_author}"
            }
            }
        ]
    }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
