# Automations

An Automation is an event, action pair where a specific event in W&B will kick off a downstream action, such as a [Launch Job](../launch/create-job.md). Use Automations to easily trigger workflow steps, such as automated model testing and deployment, on your own infrastructure with a lightweight Launch connector.

## Types of automation

You can automatically trigger actions based on two types of events:

1. **A new version is added to a registered model**: Each time a new model version is linked, this automation will run. This is useful for Model CI — run testing on each new model candidate. 

2. **An artifact alias is added**: Specify an alias that represents a special step of your workflow, like `deploy`, and any time a new model version has that alias applied, it will automatically run this automation. This would let you automatically trigger a deployment job.

## Infrastructure

Use [Launch](../launch/intro.md) to set up a connection to your own compute resources, whether that’s a GPU machine at your desk or a scalable cloud Kubernetes cluster.
