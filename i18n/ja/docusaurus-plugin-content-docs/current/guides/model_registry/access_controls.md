# Data governance and access control

<!-- # Protect model aliases -->
Use *protected aliases* to represent key stages of your model development pipeline. Protected aliases can only be added, modified, or removed by *Model Registry Admins*. Model registry admins can define and use protected aliases. Non admin users are blocked from adding and removing protected aliases from model versions.

:::info
Only Team admins or current registry admins can manage the list of registry admins.
:::


For example, suppose you set `staging` and `production` as protected aliases. Any member of your team can add new model versions.  However, only admins can add a `staging` or `production` alias.
