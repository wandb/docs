# Java Library

Similar to our Python library, we offer a Java client to instrument your machine learning model and track experiments. This library consists of two simple classes that are used as a wrapper around the Python Library.

You can find the source code for the Java Client in the [Github repository](https://github.com/wandb/client-ng-java).

:::info
Our Java integration is still in Beta, if you run into issues please let us know!

### Installation

1. Install the latest version of the wandb Python client: `pip install wandb[grpc] --upgrade`
2.  Simply include the Wandb jar file in your Java Project.

    **Maven**: this can be included by adding the jar file to your `pom.xml` file.
    Using maven repository:

    ```markup
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.wandb.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>client-ng-java</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    Or you can download the jar file directly from the [Github Package](https://github.com/wandb/client-ng-java/packages/381057):

    ```markup
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.wandb.client</groupId>
            <artifactId>client-ng-java</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>system</scope>
            <systemPath>/root/path/to/jar/file.jar</systemPath>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ```
