# Data and model versioning

<head>
  <title>Version data and models with Artifacts</title>
</head>

Use W&B Artifacts for dataset versioning, model versioning, and tracking dependencies and results across machine learning pipelines. Think of an artifact as a versioned folder of data. You can store entire datasets directly in artifacts, or use artifact references to point to data in other systems like S3, GCP, or your own system.

## Artifacts Quickstart

The easiest way to log an artifact is passing a path to your data files. Remember to also specify a name and an artifact type.

```
wandb.log_artifact(file_path, name='new_artifact', type='my_dataset') 
```

This will create a new artifact in your project's workspace:

### Log a new version

If you log again, we'll checksum the artifact, identify that something changed, and track the new version. If nothing changes, we don't re-upload any data or create a new version.

```
artifact = wandb.Artifact('new_artifact', type='my_dataset')
artifact.add_dir('nature_100/')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

![In your Artifact page, click on the Compare button to see a new folder appears in the new version](/images/data_model_versioning/artifacts_page_compare.png)

### Use your artifact

In a separate run, you can retrieve and download a specific version of an artifact to a local path:

```
artifact = run.use_artifact('user_name/project_name/new_artifact:v1', type='my_dataset')
artifact_dir = artifact.download()
```

## How it works

Using our Artifacts API, you can log artifacts as outputs of W&B runs, or use artifacts as input to runs.

Since a run can use another run’s output artifact as input, artifacts and runs together form a directed graph. You don’t need to define pipelines ahead of time. Just use and log artifacts, and we’ll stitch everything together.

Here's an [example artifact](https://app.wandb.ai/shawn/detectron2-11/artifacts/model/run-1cxg5qfx-model/4a0e3a7c5bff65ff4f91/graph) where you can see the summary view of the DAG, as well as the zoomed-out view of every execution of each step and every artifact version.
