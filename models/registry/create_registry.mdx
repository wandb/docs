A registry offers flexibility and control over the artifact types that you can use, allows you to restrict the registry's visibility, and more.


## Create a registry

Create a registry either programmatically using the W&B Registry UI or the W&B Python SDK.

<Tabs>
<Tab title=" W&B Registry UI">
1. Navigate to the W&B Registry at https://wandb.ai/registry/.
2. Click on the **Create registry** button.
3. Provide a name for the registry in the **Name** field.
4. Optionally provide a description about the registry.
5. Select who can view the registry from the **Registry visibility** dropdown. See [Registry visibility types](./configure_registry#registry-visibility-types) for more information on registry visibility options.
6. Select either **All types** or **Specify types** from the **Accepted artifacts type** dropdown.
7. (If you select **Specify types**) Add one or more artifact types that your registry accepts.
8. Click on the **Create registry** button.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python SDK">
Use the [`wandb.Api().create_registry()`](/models/ref/python/#method-apicreate_registry) method to create a registry programmatically. Provide a name and [visibility](#visibility-types) for the registry for the `name` and `visibility` parameters, respectively.

Copy and paste the code block below. Replace the values enclosed in `<>` with your own:

```python
import wandb

registry = wandb.Api().create_registry(
    name="<registry_name>",
    visibility="< 'restricted' | 'organization' >",
)
```

See the  [`wandb.Api().create_registry()`](/models/ref/python/#method-apicreate_registry) method reference for a full list of parameters that you can provide when you create a registry.

<Note>
An artifact type cannot be removed from a registry once it is saved in the registry's settings.
</Note>

For example, the following image shows a registry called `Fine_Tuned_Models` that a user is about to create. The registry is **Restricted** to only members that are manually added to the registry.

## Visibility types

The *visibility* of a registry determines who can access that registry. Restricting the visibility of a registry helps ensure that only specified members can access that registry.

There are two type registry visibility options for a registry: 

| Visibility | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| Restricted   | Only invited organization members can access the registry.| 
| Organization | Everyone in the org can access the registry. |

A team administrator or registry administrator can set the visibility of a registry.

The user who creates a registry with Restricted visibility is added to the registry automatically as its registry admin. 


## Configure the visibility of a registry

A team administrator or registry administrator can assign the visibility of a registry during or after the creation of a registry. 

To restrict the visibility of an existing registry:

1. Navigate to the W&B Registry at https://wandb.ai/registry/.
2. Select a registry.
3. Click on the gear icon on the upper right hand corner.
4. From the **Registry visibility** dropdown, select the desired registry visibility.
5. if you select **Restricted visibility**:
   1. Add members of your organization that you want to have access to this registry. Scroll to the **Registry members and roles** section and click on the **Add member** button. 
   2. Within the **Member** field, add the email or username of the member you want to add.
   3. Click **Add new member**.

See [Create a registry](./create_registry#create-a-custom-registry) for more information on how assign the visibility of a registry when a team administrator creates it.
