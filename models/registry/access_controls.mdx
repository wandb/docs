Use *protected aliases* to represent key stages of your development pipeline. Only Registry Admins can add, modify, or remove protected aliases. Registry admins can define and use protected aliases. W&B blocks non admin users from adding or removing protected aliases from artifact versions.

<Note>
Only team admins or current registry admins can manage the list of registry admins.
</Note>

For example, suppose you set `staging` and `production` as protected aliases. Any member of your team can add new artifact versions. However, only admins can add a `staging` or `production` alias.
