This page gives an overview of creating and managing W&B [automations](/models/automations/). For more detailed instructions, refer to [Create a Slack automation](/models/automations/create-automations/slack/) or [Create a webhook automation](/models/automations/create-automations/webhook/).

</Note>

## Requirements
- A team admin can create and manage automations for the team's projects, as well as components of their automations, such as webhooks, secrets, and Slack integrations. Refer to [Team settings](/platform/app/settings-page/teams/).
- To create a registry automation, you must have access to the registry. Refer to [Configure Registry access](/models/registry/configure_registry/#registry-roles).
- To create a Slack automation, you must have permission to post to the Slack instance and channel you select.

## Create an automation
You can create an automation using the W&B App or the Python SDK. Select a tab to continue.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="W&B App">
Create an automation from the project or registry's **Automations** tab. At a high level, to create an automation, follow these steps:

1. If necessary, [create a W&B secret](/platform/secrets/) for each sensitive string required by the automation, such as an access token, password, or SSH key. Secrets are defined in your **Team Settings**. Secrets are most commonly used in webhook automations.
1. Configure team-level webhook or Slack integrations to authorize W&B to post to Slack or run the webhook on your behalf. A single webhook or Slack integration can be used by multiple automations. These actions are defined in your **Team Settings**. 
1. In the project or registry, create the automation, which specifies the event to watch for and the action to take (such as posting to Slack or running a webhook). When you create a webhook automation, you configure the payload it sends.

Or, from a line plot in the workspace, you can quickly create a [run metric automation](/models/automations/automation-events/#run-events) for the metric it shows:

1. Hover over the panel, then click the bell icon at the top of the panel.

    <Frame>
    <img src="/images/automations/run_metric_automation_from_panel.png" alt="Automation bell icon location"  />
    </Frame>
1. Configure the automation using the basic or advanced configuration controls. For example, apply a run filter to limit the scope of the automation, or configure an absolute threshold.

For details, refer to:

- [Create a Slack automation](/models/automations/create-automations/slack/)
- [Create a webhook automation](/models/automations/create-automations/webhook/)

</Tab>
<Tab title="Python SDK">
To create an automation using the Python SDK, define the [event and scope](/models/ref/python/automations#events-triggers), the [action](/models/ref/python/automations#actions) to take, and [filters](https://docs.wandb.ai/models/ref/python/automations#filters) (optional). Next, use [`api.create_automation`](/models/ref/python/public-api/api#method-api-create-automation) to create the automation.

This example code creates an automation that sends a Slack notification whenever a metric called `custom-metric` exceeds `10`. `custom-metric` is expected to be logged during training using `wandb.Run.log({"custom-metric": value })`.

```python
import wandb
from wandb.automations import OnRunMetric, RunEvent, SendNotification

api = wandb.Api()

project = api.project("<my-project>", entity="<my-team>")

# Use the first Slack integration for the team
slack_hook = next(api.slack_integrations(entity="<my-team>"))

# Create a trigger event
event = OnRunMetric(
     scope=project,
     filter=RunEvent.metric("custom-metric") > 10,
)

# Create an action that responds to the event
action = SendNotification.from_integration(slack_hook)

# Create the automation
automation = api.create_automation(
     event >> action,
     name="my-automation",
     description="Send a Slack message whenever 'custom-metric' exceeds 10.",
)
```

For more details about creating automations programmatically, see the [Automations SDK reference](/models/ref/python/automations)

## View and manage automations
You can view and manage automations using the W&B App or the Python SDK. Select a tab to continue.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="W&B App">
View and manage automations from a project or registry's **Automations** tab.

- To view an automation's details, click its name.
- To view an automation's execution history, click its name and select the **History** tab. See [View an automation's history](/models/automations/view-automation-history) for details.
- To edit an automation, click its action `...` menu, then click **Edit automation**.
- To delete an automation, click its action `...` menu, then click **Delete automation**.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python SDK">
### List automations
To list automations, use the [`Api.automations`](/models/ref/python/public-api/api#method-api-automations) method. Optionally, set the `entity` parameter to a team to return only automations from that team. For example:

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()
automations = api.automations(entity="my-team")
```
If you omit the entity, all automations are returned that you have permission to view, regardless of the team.

### Update an automation
To edit an automation programmatically, use the [`Api.update_automation`](/models/ref/python/public-api/api#method-api-update-automation) method. Set the `name` parameter to the name of the automation to update. You can update any detail about the automation, including the name, description, action, event, or scope, or turn the automation on or off by changing the value of `enabled`.

This example turns off an automation and edits its description:
```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

automation = api.automation(name="my-automation")
automation.enabled = False
automation.description = "Kept for reference, but no longer used."

updated_automation = api.update_automation(automation)
```

### Delete an automation
To delete an automation programmatically, use the [`Api.delete_automation`](/models/ref/python/public-api/api#method-api-delete-automation) method, which accepts either an `Automation` object or the automation ID passed as a string.
