An automation can start when a specific event occurs within a project or registry. Learn more about automations in the [Automations overview](/models/automations/) or [Create an automation](/models/automations/create-automations/).

| Action                                           | Registry scope | Project scope |

## Artifact events
In a particular registry, an automation can start when an artifact version is linked or aliased. Automations in a given registry apply to all of the registry's collections.

In a project, an automation can start when an artifact version is created, tagged, or aliased. Project automations are scoped to the team and apply to all of the project's collections.

Regular expressions are supported for aliases and tags.

## Run status change
<Note>
- Currently available only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).
- A run with **Killed** status cannot trigger an automation. This status indicates that the run was stopped forcibly by an admin user.
</Note>

In a project, an automation can start when a run changes its [status](/models/runs/#run-states) to **Running**, **Finished**, or **Failed**. An automation cannot start when a run's status is **Killed**.

Optionally, you can further limit the runs that can trigger an automation by specifying a [user or run name filter](#run-filters).

Because run status is a property of the entire run, you can create a run status automation only from the **Automations** page.

## Run metric events
<Note>
Currently available only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).
</Note>

In a project, an automation can start when a logged value for a metric meets a given threshold or changes by a given threshold. A [system metric](/models/ref/python/experiments/system-metrics), such as `cpu`, can trigger an automation. W&B logs system metrics automatically every 15 seconds.

You can create a run metrics automation from the project's **Automations** tab or directly from a line plot panel in a workspace.

To set up a run metric automation, you configure how to compare the metric's value with the threshold you specify. Your choices depend on the event type and on any filters you specify.

Optionally, you can further limit the runs that can trigger an automation by specifying a [user or run name filter](#run-filters).

### Threshold
For **Run metrics threshold met** events, you configure:
1. The window of most recently logged values to consider (defaults to 5).
1. Whether to evaluate the **Average**, **Min**, or **Max** value within the window.
1. The comparison to make:
      - Above
      - Above or equal to
      - Below
      - Below or equal to
      - Not equal to
      - Equal to

For example, trigger an automation when average `accuracy` is above `.6`.

### Change threshold
For **Run metrics change threshold met** events, the automation uses two "windows" of values to check whether to start:

- The _current window_ of recently logged values to consider (defaults to 10).
- The _prior window_ of recently logged values to consider (defaults to 50).

The current and prior windows are consecutive and do not overlap.

To create the automation, you configure:
1. The current window of logged values (defaults to 10).
1. The prior window of logged values (defaults to 50).
1. Whether to evaluate the values as relative or absolute (defaults to **Relative**).
1. The comparison to make:
      - Increases by at least
      - Decreases by at least
      - Increases or decreases by at least

For example, trigger an automation when average `loss` decreases by at least `.25`.

## Run filters
This section describes how the automation selects runs to evaluate.

- By default, any run in the project triggers the automation when the event occurs. You can limit which runs trigger an automation by configuring one of the following filters: 
  - **Filter to one user's runs**: Include only runs created by the specified user.
  - **Filter on run name**: Include only runs whose names match the given regular expression.

  For details, see [Create automations](/models/automations/create-automations/).
- Each run is considered individually and can potentially trigger the automation.
- Each run's values are put into a separate window and compared to the threshold separately.
- In a 24 hour period, a particular automation can fire at most once per run.
