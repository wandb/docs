An automation can start when a specific event occurs within a registry, project, or collection. This page describes the events that can trigger an automation within each scope. Learn more about automations in the [Automations overview](/models/automations/) or [Create an automation](/models/automations/create-automations/).

Select a tab to learn more about the available events at a given scope.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Registry events">
A [Registry](/models/registry/) automation starts when an event occurs in any collection within a specific registry:

- **A new version is linked to a collection**: Test and validate new models or datasets when they are added to a registry.
- **An artifact alias is added**: Trigger a specific step of your workflow when a new artifact version has a specific alias applied. For example, deploy a model when it has the `production` alias applied. Regular expressions are supported.

The registry's automations automatically apply to collections added in the future.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Project events">
A [project](/models/track/project-page) automation starts when an event occurs in the project or any of its collections. Broadly, project automations relate to artifacts or runs.

The registry's automations automatically apply to collections added in the future.

## Artifacts
Start an automation when:
- **A new version is added to an artifact**: Apply recurring actions to each version of an artifact. For example, start a training job when a new dataset artifact version is created.
- **An artifact alias is added**: Trigger a specific step of your workflow when a new artifact version in a project has an alias applied that matches the **Alias regex** you specify. For example, run a series of downstream processing steps when an artifact has the `test-set-quality-check` alias applied, or run a workflow each time a new artifact version has the `latest` alias. Only one artifact version can have a given alias at a point in time. Regular expressions are supported.
- **An artifact tag is added**: Trigger a specific step of your workflow when an artifact version in a project has a tag applied that matches the **Tag regex** you specify. For example, specify `^europe.*` to trigger a geo-specific workflow when a tag beginning with the string `europe` is added to an artifact version. Artifact tags are used for grouping and filtering, and a given tag can be assigned to multiple artifact versions simultaneously. Regular expressions are supported.

## Runs
<Note>
Currently available only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).
</Note>

Start an automation when:
- **Run status change**: Trigger a specific step of youre workflow when a run's status changes to **Running**, **Finished**, or **Failed**.
    
    <Info>A run with **Killed** status cannot trigger an automation. This status indicates that the run was stopped forcibly by an admin user.</Info>
- **Run metrics threshold met** or **Run metrics change threshold met**: Trigger a specific step of your workflow based on a logged value for a metric. A metric in a run's history or a [system metric](/models/ref/python/experiments/system-metrics) like `cpu` can trigger an automation.

    - A run metrics threshold defines the comparison to make and the window of values to consider.
    - A run metrics change threshold defines the comparison to make and the current and previous windows of values to consider.

    For details, see [Configure run metrics thresholds](#configure-run-metrics-thresholds).

You can further limit the runs that can trigger an automation by specifying a [user or run name filter](#configure-run-filters).

### Configure run metrics thresholds
<Note>
Currently available only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).
</Note>

This section gives details about configuring the threshold or change threshold that starts a run metrics automation.

Each run is considered individually and can potentially trigger an automation. To determine whether the conditions are met, each run's values are put into a separate window and compared to the threshold separately. However, in a 24 hour period, a particular automation can fire at most once per run. 

In a 24 hour period, a particular automation can fire at most once per run.

Select a tab for configuration details.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Threshold">
For **Run metrics threshold met** events, you configure:
1. The window of most recently logged values to consider (defaults to 5).
1. Whether to evaluate the **Average**, **Min**, or **Max** value within the window.
1. The comparison to make:
      - Above
      - Above or equal to
      - Below
      - Below or equal to
      - Not equal to
      - Equal to

For example, trigger an automation when average `accuracy` is above `.6`.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Change threshold">
For **Run metrics change threshold met** events, the automation uses two "windows" of values to check whether to start:

- The _current window_ of recently logged values to consider (defaults to 10).
- The _prior window_ of recently logged values to consider (defaults to 50).

The current and prior windows are consecutive and do not overlap.

To create the automation, you configure:
1. The current window of logged values (defaults to 10).
1. The prior window of logged values (defaults to 50).
1. Whether to evaluate the values as relative or absolute (defaults to **Relative**).
1. The comparison to make:
      - Increases by at least
      - Decreases by at least
      - Increases or decreases by at least

For example, trigger an automation when average `loss` decreases by at least `.25`.

### Configure run filters
By default, any run in the project can trigger an automation based on the run's status or logged metrics. To limit the runs that can start an automation, specify one or more filters:

- **Filter to one user's runs**: Include only runs created by the specified user.
- **Filter on run name**: Include only runs whose names match the given regular expression.

  For details, see [Create automations](/models/automations/create-automations/).
