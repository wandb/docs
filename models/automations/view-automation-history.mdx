This page describes how to view and understand the execution history of your W&B [automations](/models/automations), including what triggered an automation, what actions were taken, and whether they succeeded or failed.

## Overview

Each executed automation generates a record that includes:
- **Execution timestamp**: When the automation was triggered.
- **Triggering event**: The specific event triggered the automation.
- **Status**: The execution's status. See [Execution status](#execution-status).
- **Action details**: Information about what action was performed, such as notifying a Slack channel or running a webhook.
- **Result details**: Additional information, if any, about the final outcome of executing the automation, including the error for a failed execution.

- **Finished**: The automation completed all actions successfully.
- **Failed**: The automation encountered an error and could not complete.
- **Pending**: The automation is queued for execution.


### Execution details

Click on any execution in the history to view:

- **Event details**: The specific event that triggered the automation, including:
  - Event type (e.g., "New artifact version", "Run completed")
  - Entity information (run ID, artifact name, etc.)
  - User who triggered the event (if applicable)

- **Action details**: Information about what the automation attempted to do:
  - Action type (Slack notification or webhook)
  - Target (Slack channel or webhook URL)
  - Payload sent (for webhooks)

- **Result information**:
  - Response status (for webhooks)
