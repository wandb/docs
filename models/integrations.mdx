---

W&B integrates with popular machine learning frameworks, cloud platforms, and workflow orchestration tools to help you track experiments, log metrics, and manage models seamlessly.

## Popular ML integrations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="PyTorch Lightning" href="/models/integrations/lightning">
Integrate W&B with your PyTorch Lightning code to add experiment tracking to your pipeline.
</Card>
<Card title="HuggingFace Transformers" href="/models/integrations/huggingface">
Optimize HuggingFace Transformer models with W&B for experiment tracking and model management.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Keras" href="/models/integrations/keras">
Use W&B and Keras for machine learning experiment tracking, dataset versioning, and project collaboration.
</Card>
<Card title="YOLOv5" href="/models/integrations/yolov5">
Use the "You Only Look Once" (aka YOLOv5) real-time object detection framework and W&B to track model metrics, inspect model outputs, and restart interrupted runs.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

If the library you use is not supported natively, you can still integrate W&B using the W&B [Python SDK](/models/ref/python). See [Add W&B to any library](/models/integrations/add-wandb-to-any-library) for best practices and implementation guidance.
