title: Why am I getting rate limit errors (429) with W&B Inference?
---

Rate limit errors (429) occur when you exceed concurrency limits.

**Error:** "Concurrency limit reached for requests"

**Solution:**
- Reduce the number of parallel requests
- Add delays between requests
- Implement exponential backoff
- Note: Rate limits apply per W&B project

## Best practices to avoid rate limits

1. **Implement retry logic with exponential backoff:**
   ```python
   import time
   
   def retry_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
       for i in range(max_retries):
           try:
               return func()
           except Exception as e:
               if "429" in str(e) and i < max_retries - 1:
                   time.sleep(2 ** i)
               else:
                   raise
   ```

2. **Use batch processing instead of parallel requests**

3. **Monitor your usage in the W&B Billing page**

## Default spending caps

- **Pro accounts:** $6,000/month
- **Enterprise accounts:** $700,000/year

Contact your account executive or support to adjust limits.
