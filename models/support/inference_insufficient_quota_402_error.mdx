title: Why am I getting insufficient quota errors (402) with W&B Inference?
---

Insufficient quota errors (402) occur when you do not have remaining credits in your plan.

**Error:** "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"

**Solution:**

- Check your credit balance in the W&B Billing page
- Purchase more credits or upgrade your plan
- Request a limit increase from [support](https://wandb.ai/site/contact)
