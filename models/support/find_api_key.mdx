## Find your API keys

<ApiKeyFind/>

## Delete an API key

To revoke access, delete the API key:

### Personal API keys

1. Navigate to [wandb.ai/settings](https://wandb.ai/settings).
1. In the the **API Keys** section, click the delete button next to the key you want to delete.
4. Confirm the deletion.

### Service account API keys

For information about managing service account API keys, see [Use service accounts to automate workflows](/platform/hosting/iam/service-accounts).

<Warning>
Deleting an API key immediately revokes access for any scripts or services using that key. Ensure you have updated all systems to use a new key before deleting the old one.
</Warning>

## Replace an API key

To replace (rotate) an API key:

1. [Create a new API key](#create-a-new-api-key).
2. Update all scripts, services, and environments to use the new API key.
3. Test that the new API key works in all locations.
4. Delete the old API key.
