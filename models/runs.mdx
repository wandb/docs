description: Learn about the basic building block of W&B, Runs.
title: Overview
---


A *run* is a single unit of computation logged by W&B. You can think of a W&B Run as an atomic element of your whole project. In other words, each run is a record of a specific computation, such as training a model and logging the results, hyperparameter sweeps, and so forth.

Common patterns for initiating a run include, but are not limited to: 

* Training a model
* Changing a hyperparameter and conducting a new experiment
* Conducting a new machine learning experiment with a different model
* Logging data or a model as a [W&B Artifact](/models/artifacts/)
* [Downloading a W&B Artifact](/models/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact/)


Each run has a [unique identifier known as a *run ID*](/models/runs/run-identifiers#unique-run-identifiers). [You can specify a unique ID](/models/runs/run-identifiers#unique-run-identifiers) or let [W&B randomly generate one for you](/models/runs/run-identifiers#autogenerated-run-ids).

Each run also has a human-readable, non-unique [run name](/models/runs/run-identifiers#run-name). You can specify a name for your run or let W&B randomly generate one for you. You can rename a run after initializing it.

W&B logs your run to a [*project*](/models/track/project-page/). You specify the project when you initialize the run with `wandb.init(project=)`. W&B creates a new project if the project does not exist. If the project does exist, W&B logs the run to the project specified.

<Note>
If you do not specify a project name, W&B stores the run in a project called `Uncategorized`.
</Note>

Use the run object returned by `wandb.init()` to log metrics, artifacts, and other information to the run. Anything you log with `wandb.Run.log()` is recorded to that run.

Each run has a state that describes the current status of the run. See [Run states](/models/runs/run-states) for a full list of possible run states.

[View runs and their properties](/models/runs/view-logged-runs) within the run's project workspace on the W&B App. You can also programmatically access run properties with the [`wandb.Api.Run`](/models/ref/python/experiments/run) object.

As an example, consider the following code snippet that initializes a W&B run and logs some metrics to it:

<Note>
Pass your W&B entity to the `entity` variable in the code snippets below if you want to follow along. Your entity is your W&B username or team name. You can find it in the URL of your W&B App workspace. For example, if your workspace URL is `https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project`, then your entity is `nico`.
</Note>

```python
import wandb

entity = "nico"  # Replace with your W&B entity
project = "awesome-project"

with wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project) as run:
    run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "loss": 0.1})
```

The first line imports the W&B Python SDK. The second line initializes a run in the project `awesome-project` under the entity `nico`. The third line logs the accuracy and loss of the model to that run.

Within the terminal, W&B returns:

```bash
wandb: Syncing run earnest-sunset-1
wandb: ⭐️ View project at https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project
wandb: 🚀 View run at https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project/runs/1jx1ud12

```

The URL W&B returns in the terminal to redirects you to the run's workspace in the W&B App UI. Note that the panels generated in the workspace corresponds to the single point.

Logging a metrics at a single point of time might not be that useful. A more realistic example in the case of training discriminative models is to log metrics at regular intervals. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python
import wandb
import random

config = {
    "epochs": 10,
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
}

with wandb.init(project="awesome-project", config=config) as run:
    print(f"lr: {config['learning_rate']}")
      
    # Simulating a training run
    for epoch in range(config['epochs']):
      offset = random.random() / 5
      acc = 1 - 2**-epoch - random.random() / (epoch + 1) - offset
      loss = 2**-epoch + random.random() / (epoch + 1) + offset
      print(f"epoch={epoch}, accuracy={acc}, loss={loss}")
      run.log({"accuracy": acc, "loss": loss})
```

The training script calls `wandb.Run.log()` 10 times. Each time the script calls `wandb.Run.log()`, W&B logs the accuracy and loss for that epoch.

Within your terminal, you should see output similar to the following:

```bash
wandb: Syncing run jolly-haze-4
wandb: ⭐️ View project at https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project
wandb: 🚀 View run at https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project/runs/pdo5110r

W&B captures the simulated training loop within a single run called `jolly-haze-4`. This is because the script calls `wandb.init()` method only once.

Copy and paste the URL that W&B prints from the previous output into your browser. The URL directs you to the run's workspace in the W&B App UI. For example, the following image shows the workspace for the run `jolly-haze-4`:

## Add a note to a run
Notes that you add to a specific run appear on the run page in the **Overview** tab and in the table of runs on the project page.

1. Navigate to your W&B project
2. Select the **Workspace** tab from the project sidebar
3. Select the run you want to add a note to from the run selector
4. Choose the **Overview** tab
5. Select the pencil icon next to the **Description** field and add your notes

{/* ### Search runs

Search for a specific run by name in the sidebar. You can use regex to filter down your visible runs. The search box affects which runs are shown on the graph. Here's an example:
