Re-enable W&B after it was deactivated.

    Set the mode to `online` to restore full W&B functionality,
    including cloud syncing and artifact storage.
    
    Undos a previous call to `wandb disabled`. Do not
    upload data logged while W&B was set to `disabled`, but allow
    new data to be logged and synced.

    use ``wandb online`` or ``wandb offline`` instead.

    Examples:

    Restore W&B functionality after deactivating it with `wandb disabled`

    ```bash
    wandb enabled
    python train.py # Log and sync data to W&B
    ```
