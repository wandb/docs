Create a job from a source, without a wandb run.

Jobs can be of three types, git, code, or image.

git: A git source, with an entrypoint either in the path or provided explicitly pointing to the main python executable. code: A code path, containing a requirements.txt file. image: A docker image.

```bash
wandb job create JOB_TYPE PATH [OPTIONS]
