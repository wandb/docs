Start a local sweep controller for a W&B hyperparameter sweep.
    
    Start a local process that orchestrates the specified sweep. Read the
    sweep configuration from W&B, select hyperparameter combinations based
    on the configured search strategy (grid, random, Bayesian, and so on),
    and dispatch runs to sweep agents.

    By default, W&B runs sweep controllers on its managed infrastructure.
    Use this command to run the controller locally instead. For example, you
    can use this command to debug behavior or operate in environments with
    limited connectivity.

    ``sweep_id`` is printed by `wandb sweep` when you create a sweep. It
    consists of a unique identifier for the sweep and may include the
    entity and project path (`entity/project/sweep_id`).

    Examples:

    Start a local sweep controller for a sweep with sweep ID "wbyz9876"

    ```bash
    wandb controller wbyz9876
    ```
    

## Usage

```shell
wandb controller [OPTIONS] SWEEP_ID
```


## Options

### `verbose`

Display verbose output from controller.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--verbose` | False | BOOL |

### `help`

Show this message and exit.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--help` | False | BOOL |
