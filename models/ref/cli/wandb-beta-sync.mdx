title: wandb beta-sync
---


Upload .wandb files specified by PATHS.

    This is a beta re-implementation of `wandb sync`.
    It is not feature complete, not guaranteed to work, and may change
    in backward-incompatible ways in any release of wandb.

    PATHS can include .wandb files, run directories containing .wandb files,
    and "wandb" directories containing run directories.

    For example, to sync all runs in a directory:

        wandb beta sync ./wandb

    To sync a specific run:

        wandb beta sync ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude

    Or equivalently:

        wandb beta sync ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude/run-n67z9ude.wandb
    

## Usage

```shell
wandb beta sync [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...
```

## Arguments

### `paths`

| Name | Default | Type |
|------|---------|------|
| `paths` | None | File Path |

## Options

### `live`

Sync a run while it's still being logged.

This may hang if the process generating the run crashes uncleanly.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--live` | False | BOOL |

### `entity`

An entity override to use for all runs being synced.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `-e, --entity` |  | STRING |

### `project`

A project override to use for all runs being synced.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `-p, --project` |  | STRING |

### `run_id`

A run ID override to use for all runs being synced.

If setting this and syncing multiple files (with the same entity
and project), the files will be synced in order of start time.
This is intended to work with syncing multiple resumed fragments
of the same run.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--id` |  | STRING |

### `job_type`

A job type override for all runs being synced.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--job-type` |  | STRING |

### `replace_tags`

Rename tags using the format 'old1=new1,old2=new2'.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--replace-tags` |  | STRING |

### `skip_synced`

Skip runs that have already been synced with this command.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--skip-synced` | True | BOOL |

### `dry_run`

Print what would happen without uploading anything.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--dry-run` | False | BOOL |

### `verbose`

Print more information.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `-v, --verbose` | False | BOOL |

### `n`

Max number of runs to sync at a time.

When syncing multiple files that are part of the same run,
the files are synced sequentially in order of start time
regardless of this setting. This happens for resumed runs
or when using the --id parameter.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `-n` | 5 | INT |

### `help`

Show this message and exit.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `--help` | False | BOOL |
