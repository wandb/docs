Start a sweep agent.

    Poll the W&B server for hyperparameter configurations from
    the sweep and start a run for each configuration.
    
    The agent exits when the sweep completes, the sweep
    is stopped, cancelled, or the `--count` limit is reached.

    Find the sweep ID in:
      * The W&B App at `https://wandb.ai/entity/project/sweeps`. Replace
        `entity` and `project` with your entity and project names.
      * The output of the `wandb sweep` command when you create a new sweep.
    
    The sweep ID can include the entity and project path
    (`entity/project/sweep_id`) or the eight character sweep ID alone.

    Examples:

    Start an agent for a sweep with a sweep ID of "wbyz9876"

    ```bash
    wandb agent wbyz9876
    ```

    Start an agent with a run limit of 10 runs for the sweep

    ```bash
    wandb agent --count 10 wbyz9876
    ```

    Start an agent for a sweep and save it to a project
    called "sweeps-project" that belongs to the "team-awesome" entity

    ```bash
    wandb agent -p sweeps-project -e team-awesome wbyz9876
    ```

    Forward signals to child runs for clean shutdown

    ```bash
    wandb agent --forward-signals wbyz9876
    ```
    

## Usage

```shell
wandb agent [OPTIONS] SWEEP_ID
```


## Options

### `project`

Set the project to upload runs to.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|

### `forward_signals`

Forward signals (e.g. SIGINT/SIGTERM) to child runs so they can shut down cleanly.                

| Flag | Default | Type | 
|------|---------|------|
| `-f, --forward-signals` | False | BOOL |
