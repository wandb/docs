Run integration checks against a self-hosted W&B instance.

    Validate that a self-hosted or dedicated cloud W&B deployment is configured
    and operating correctly. Do not run this command against the public W&B
    cloud at `api.wandb.ai`.

    The following checks are run in order:
    1. Host check - Verify the host is not `api.wandb.ai`.
    2. Login check - Verify the API key authenticates successfully.
    3. Secure requests check - Verify requests use HTTPS.
    4. Large payload check - Verify the instance handles large payloads (~10MB).
    5. Secure requests check - Verify signed URL requests use HTTPS.
    6. CORS configuration - Verify the object store allows GET and PUT requests
        from the W&B instance.
    7. W&B version - Verify the installed W&B package is compatible with the instance.
    8. Run check - Log metrics, save files, and download files to verify runs
        are recorded and accessible.
    9. Artifact check - Save and download artifacts to verify artifact storage
        and retrieval work correctly.
    10. Sweeps check - Create and execute a random sweep to verify the sweep
        system functions correctly.

    Exits with `code 1` if any critical check fails.

    Examples:

    Verify the currently configured W&B instance.

    ```bash
    wandb verify --host https://my-wandb-instance.com
    ```

    Verify a specific self-hosted instance.

    ```bash
    wandb verify --host https://my-wandb-server.example.com 
    ```
