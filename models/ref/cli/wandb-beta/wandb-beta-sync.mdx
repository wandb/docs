Upload .wandb files specified by PATHS.

This is a beta re-implementation of `wandb sync`. It is not feature complete, not guaranteed to work, and may change in backward-incompatible ways in any release of wandb.

PATHS can include .wandb files, run directories containing .wandb files, and "wandb" directories containing run directories.

For example, to sync all runs in a directory:

wandb beta sync ./wandb

To sync a specific run:

wandb beta sync ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude

Or equivalently:

wandb beta sync ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude/run-n67z9ude.wandb

## Usage
