title: Python SDK 0.23.0
module:
---
The W&B Python SDK, accessible at `wandb`, enables you to train and fine-tune models, and manage models from experimentation to production. 

> After performing your training and fine-tuning operations with this SDK, you can use [the Public API](/models/ref/python/public-api) to query and analyze the data that was logged, and [the Reports and Workspaces API](/models/ref/wandb_workspaces) to generate a web-publishable [report](/models/reports/) summarizing your work.

## Installation and setup

### Sign up and create an API key

To authenticate your machine with W&B, you must first generate an API key at https://wandb.ai/authorize.

### Install and import packages

Install the W&B Python SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install wandb
```

### Import W&B Python SDK

The following code snippet demonstrates how to import the W&B Python SDK and initialize a run. Replace `<team_entity>` with your team entity name.

```python
import wandb

# Specify your team entity
entity = "<team_entity>"

# Project that the run is recorded to
project = "my-awesome-project"

with wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project) as run:
   run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "loss": 0.1})
```

### Install optional dependencies

Install compatible versions of optional dependencies for enhanced functionality. To install an optional dependency, use the following command, replacing `extra` with the desired package:

```bash
pip install wandb[extra]
```

For example, to install W&B with Google Cloud Storage support, run:

```bash
pip install wandb[gcp]
```

Install more than one optional dependency by separating them with commas:

```bash
pip install wandb[gcp,aws,media]
```

#### Supported optional dependencies

| Package | Purpose |

| `media` | Packages for media handling, video/image processing, plotting, and cheminformatics (RDKit).|
| `sweeps`| Manage sweeps. |
| `launch` | Installs cloud providers and orchestration platforms (includes many cloud SDKs, notebook tools, and orchestration clients). Note: tornado has a Python-version marker. |
| `perf` | High-performance JSON serializer. |
| `importers` | Data import and helper utilities. |
| `workspaces` | W&B Reports and Workspaces SDK. |
