The W&B Python SDK, accessible at `wandb`, enables you to train and fine-tune models, and manage models from experimentation to production. 

> After performing your training and fine-tuning operations with this SDK, you can use [the Public API](/models/ref/python/public-api) to query and analyze the data that was logged, and [the Reports and Workspaces API](/models/ref/wandb_workspaces) to generate a web-publishable [report](/models/reports/) summarizing your work.

## Installation and setup

### Sign up and create an API key

To authenticate your machine with W&B, you must first generate an API key at [User Settings](https://wandb.ai/settings).

### Install and import packages

Install the W&B library.

```
pip install wandb
```

### Import W&B Python SDK:

```python
import wandb

# Specify your team entity
entity = "<team_entity>"

# Project that the run is recorded to
project = "my-awesome-project"

with wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project) as run:
   run.log({"accuracy": 0.9, "loss": 0.1})
