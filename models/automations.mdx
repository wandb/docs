This page describes _automations_ in W&B. [Create an automation](/models/automations/create-automations/) to trigger workflow steps, such as automated model testing and deployment, based on an event in W&B.

For example, an automation can notify a Slack channel when a new version is created, trigger an automated testing webhook when the `production` alias is added to an artifact, or start a validation job only when a run's `loss` is within acceptable bounds.

## Automation events

Automations can be triggered by events related to runs or artifacts in a project or registry. An automation can start:

- When a run metric meets a defined absolute or relative threshold. For example, trigger when a run's `loss` is less than 0.01 or when a run's `accuracy` improves by 5%.
- When an artifact event occurs in a project or registry. For example, trigger when a new model version is created or when the `production` alias is added to a model.

For more details, see [Automation events and scopes](/models/automations/automation-events/).

## Automation actions

When an event triggers an automation, it can perform one of these actions:

### Slack notification
Send a message to a Slack channel with details about the triggering event. The message includes relevant information such as the entity name, user who triggered the event, and a link to view more details in W&B.

### Webhook
Call a webhook URL with a JSON payload containing information about the triggering event. This enables integration with external systems like CI/CD pipelines, model deployment services, or custom workflows. The webhook payload includes:
- Event details (type, entity information)

For implementation details, see:
- [Create a Slack automation](/models/automations/create-automations/slack/)
- [Create a webhook automation](/models/automations/create-automations/webhook/)

## How automations work

To [create an automation](/models/automations/create-automations/), you:

1. If required, configure [secrets](/platform/secrets/) for sensitive strings the automation requires, such as access tokens, passwords, or sensitive configuration details. Secrets are defined in your **Team Settings**. Secrets are most commonly used in webhook automations to securely pass credentials or tokens to the webhook's external service without exposing it in plain text or hard-coding it in the webhook's payload.
1. Configure team-level webhook or Slack integrations to authorize W&B to post to Slack or run the webhook on your behalf. A single automation action (webhook or Slack notification) can be used by multiple automations. These actions are defined in your **Team Settings**.
1. In the project or registry, create the automation:
    1. Define the [event](#automation-events) to watch for, such as when a new artifact version is added. 
    1. Define the action to take when the event occurs (posting to a Slack channel or running a webhook). For a webhook, specify a secret to use for the access token and/or a secret to send with the payload, if required.

## Limitations
[Run metric automations](/models/automations/automation-events/#run-metrics-events) are currently supported only in [W&B Multi-tenant Cloud](/platform/hosting/#wb-multi-tenant-cloud).
