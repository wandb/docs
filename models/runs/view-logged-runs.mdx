View information about a specific run such as the state of the run, artifacts logged to the run, metrics logged to a run, system metrics, and more.


## View a logged run

You can view and monitor runs using the W&B App or the `wandb beta leet` terminal UI.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="WA&B App">

Navigate to a run's workspace in the W&B App to view detailed information about the run.

To view a specific run in the W&B App:

1. Navigate to the [W&B App](https://wandb.ai/home).
2. Navigate to the W&B project you specified when you initialized the run.
3. Within the project sidebar, select the **Workspace** tab.
4. Within the run selector, click the run you want to view, or enter a partial run name to filter for matching runs.

Alternatively, you can directly access a specific run's workspace by entering its URL in your browser. The URL path of a specific run has the following format:

```text
https://wandb.ai/<team-name>/<project-name>/runs/<run-id>
```

Where values enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) are placeholders for the actual values of the team name, project name, and run ID.

After you select a run, explore its properties by navigating through the tabs: [Overview](/models/runs/view-logged-runs#overview), [Logs](/models/runs/view-logged-runs#logs), [Files](/models/runs/view-logged-runs#files), [Code](/models/runs/view-logged-runs#code), and [Artifacts](/models/runs/view-logged-runs#artifacts).

</Tab>
<Tab title="LEET">

To view a run locally in your terminal using the `wandb beta leet` terminal UI:

1. If you started the run locally from a script, navigate to the directory where you ran your code. It contains a `wandb/` directory with a subdirectory per run and a `latest-run/` symbolic link. Each run directory contains a transaction log named in the format `run-<run-ID>.wandb`.

    If you did not start the run locally but downloaded a `.wandb` transaction log file instead, make a note of its location.
2. Start `wandb beta leet` using one of these commands:

   ```bash
   # View the latest run, stored in ./wandb/latest-run/
   wandb beta leet
   
   # Specify a run directory
   wandb beta leet ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude
   
   # Specify a .wandb file
   wandb beta leet ./wandb/run-20250813_124246-n67z9ude/run-n67z9ude.wandb
   ```

LEET displays a three-panel interface:

- **Left sidebar**: Run overview with environment variables, configuration, and summary statistics
- **Center panel**: Metrics grid with Braille-style line charts showing your logged metrics
- **Right sidebar**: System metrics including GPU/CPU/RAM utilization

Get started with these keyboard shortcuts:

- `h` or `?` - View all keyboard shortcuts
- `/` - Filter metrics by pattern
- `[` / `]` - Toggle left/right sidebars
- `n` / `N` - Navigate between metric pages
- `q` / `CMD+C` - Quit

See the [`wandb beta leet`](/models/ref/cli/wandb-beta/wandb-beta-leet) reference for more details.

### Overview
Use the **Overview** tab to learn about specific run information in a project, such as:

* **Author**: The W&B entity that creates the run.
* **Command**: The command that initializes the run.
* **Description**: A description of the run that you provided. This field is empty if you do not specify a description when you create the run. You can add a description to a run with the W&B App or programmatically with the Python SDK.
* **Tracked Hours**: The amount of time the run is actively computing or logging data, excluding any pauses or waiting periods. This metric helps you understand the actual computational time spent on your run.
* **Runtime**: Measures the total time from the start to the end of the run. It's the wall-clock time for the run, including any time where the run is paused or waiting for resources. This metric provides the complete elapsed time for your run.
* **Git repository**: The git repository associated with the run. You must [enable git](/platform/app/settings-page/user-settings/#personal-github-integration) to view this field.
* **Host name**: Where W&B computes the run. W&B displays the name of your machine if you initialize the run locally on your machine.
* **Name**: The name of the run.
* **OS**: Operating system that initializes the run.
* **Python executable**: The command that starts the run.
* **Python version**: Specifies the Python version that creates the run.
* **Run path**: Identifies the unique run identifier in the form `entity/project/run-ID`.
* **Start time**: The timestamp when you initialize the run.
* **State**: The [state of the run](/models/runs/run-states).
* **System hardware**: The hardware W&B uses to compute the run.
* **Tags**: A list of strings. Tags are useful for organizing related runs together or applying temporary labels like `baseline` or `production`.
* **W&B CLI version**: The W&B CLI version installed on the machine that hosted the run command.
* **Git state**: The most recent git commit SHA of a repository or working directory where the run is initialized. This field is empty if you do not enable Git when you create the run or if the git information is not available.

W&B stores the following information below the overview section:

* **Artifact Outputs**: Artifact outputs produced by the run.
* **Config**: List of config parameters saved with [`wandb.Run.config`](/models/track/config/).
* **Summary**: List of summary parameters saved with [`wandb.Run.log()`](/models/track/log/). By default, W&B sets this value to the last value logged.

### Logs 
The **Log** tab shows output printed on the command line such as the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`).

### Code
The **Code** tab displays the code files associated with a specific run. This includes the main script that was executed as well as any additional code files that were part of the run's environment.


### Artifacts

The **Artifacts** tab lists the input and output [artifacts](/models/artifacts/) for the specified run.
