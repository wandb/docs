title: Visualize CoreWeave infrastructure alerts
description: 
---

Observe infrastructure alerts such as GPU failures, thermal violations, and more during machine learning experiments you log to W&B. During a [W&B run](/models/runs), [CoreWeave Mission Control](https://coreweave.com/mission-control) monitors your compute infrastructure.

<Note>
This feature is in Preview and only available when training on a CoreWeave cluster. Contact your W&B representative for access.
</Note>

If an error occurs, CoreWeave sends that information to W&B. W&B populates infrastructure information onto your run’s plots in your project’s workspace. CoreWeave attempts to automatically resolve some issues, and W&B surfaces that information in the run’s page.
