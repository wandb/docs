The **Runs** table shows details about all of your runs in a given project. 

To view all runs logged to your project, navigate to your W&B project and select the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar. To view a specific run's details, click the run's name in the **Name** column. For more information, refer to [View a specific logged run](/models/runs/view-logged-runs/).

<Note>
Note that the terms "Runs tab" and "Runs table" are used interchangeably to refer to the same feature in the W&B App.
