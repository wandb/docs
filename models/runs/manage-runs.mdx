title: Move runs between projects and teams
description: Learn how to move runs between projects and teams using the W&B App or the W&B Python SDK.
---

Move runs from one project to another, or between teams, using either the W&B App or the W&B Python SDK. You must have access to the run at its current and new locations.

<Note>
When you move a run, historical artifacts associated with it are not moved. To move an artifact manually, you can use the [`wandb artifact get`](/models/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-get/) SDK command or the [`Api.artifact` API](/models/ref/python/public-api/api/#artifact) to download the artifact, then use [`wandb artifact put`](/models/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/wandb-artifact-put/) or the `Api.artifact` API to upload it to the run's new location.
</Note>

To customize the **Runs** tab, refer to [Project page](/models/track/project-page/#runs-tab).

If you group runs into experiments, refer to [Set a group in the UI](/models/runs/grouping/#set-a-group-in-the-ui).

## Move runs between your projects

To move runs from one project to another:

1. Navigate to the project that contains the runs you want to move.
2. Select the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Select the checkbox next to the runs you want to move.
4. Choose the **Move to project** button above the table.
5. Select the destination project from the dropdown.

## Move runs between your teams

Move runs to a team you are a member of:

1. Navigate to the project that contains the runs you want to move.
2. Select the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Select the checkbox next to the runs you want to move.
4. Choose the **Move to project** button above the table.
5. Select the destination team and project from the dropdown.

{/* ## Move runs to a group

You can group runs by moving them into an existing group or creating a new group.

1. Navigate to the project that contains the runs you want to move.
2. Select the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
3. Select the checkbox next to the runs you want to move.
4. Choose the **Move to group** button above the table.
5. In the modal, select the target group or create a new group.

{/* #### Manage runs in bulk
This section shows how to manage multiple runs at once, across one or more run groups.

1. If necessary, [toggle grouping by columns](#toggle-grouping-by-column-in-the-ui), grouping by the **Group** column.
1. Expand a group to view its runs. In a single bulk operation, you can move runs from different groups to the same target group. Expand all relevant groups.
1. To select all runs in a group, click the checkbox next to the group name.
1. To select individual runs, click their checkboxes.
1. To select all runs in all groups, click the checkbox next to the **Name** column heading.
1. Above the table, choose a bulk operation: **Tag**, **Move to group**, **Move to project**, or **New sweep**. */}
