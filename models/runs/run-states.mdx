description: Learn about the different states a W&B run can have.
---

The [Run state](/models/runs/run-states#run-states) indicates the current status of a W&B run. You can [view the state](/models/runs/run-states#view-the-state-of-a-run) of a run in the W&B App or programmatically using the W&B Python SDK.

## Run states
The following table describes the possible states a run can be in: 

| State | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `Crashed` | Run stopped sending heartbeats in the internal process, which can happen if the machine crashes. | 
| `Failed` | Run ended with a non-zero exit status. | 
| `Finished`| Run ended and fully synced data, or called `wandb.Run.finish()`. |
| `Killed` | Run was forcibly stopped before it could finish. |
| `Running` | Run is still running and has recently sent a heartbeat.  |
| `Pending` | Run is scheduled but not yet started (common in sweeps and Launch jobs). |

### Run states in sweeps

When runs are part of a [sweep](/models/sweeps/), their states behave independently from the sweep's status:

- **Individual run states** reflect each run's execution status (Running, Finished, Failed, etc.)
- **Sweep status** controls whether new runs are created, not how existing runs execute
- Pausing or stopping a sweep doesn't affect already-running runs
- Only cancelling a sweep forcibly kills running runs (changes their state to `Killed`)

For a detailed explanation of how sweep and run statuses interact, see [Understanding sweep and run statuses](/models/sweeps/pause-resume-and-cancel-sweeps#understanding-sweep-and-run-statuses).


## View the state of a run

Programmatically or interactively view a run's state with the Python SDK or W&B App.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python SDK">

Use the `state` property of the [`wandb.Api.Run`](/models/ref/python/public-api/runs) object to access the current state of a run.

The following code snippet retrieves and prints the state of all runs in a specified project. Copy and paste the following code snippet into your Python environment. Replace the values enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) with your own values:

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

runs = api.runs(path="<entity>/<project>")

# Access run object's properties
for run in runs:
    print(f"Run: {run.name}")
    print(f"Run state: {run.state}")
    print()
```

You can apply different filters to retrieve runs from your projects based on different criteria. See [Filter runs](/models/runs/filter-runs) to learn more about filtering runs programmatically.

<Tab title="W&B App">

View the state of a run from the W&B App:

1. Navigate to your W&B project.
1. Select the **Workspace** or **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
1. Search or scroll to the run you want to view.
1. Select the run to open the run overview page.
1. Choose the **Overview** tab.

Next to the **State** field, view the current state of the run.
