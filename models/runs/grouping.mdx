description: Group training and evaluation runs into larger experiments
title: Organize runs
---

Add a group name or job type to your runs to organize them into larger experiments. This is useful for organizing runs for distributed training, multiple processes, or k-fold cross-validation.

## Group runs programmatically

Each run can be categorized by **group** and a **job type**:

- **Group**: a broad category for the experiment, used to organize and filter runs.
- **Job type**: the function of the run, such as `preprocessing`, `training`, or `evaluation`.

### Group name
Add a group name to a run by passing the `group` parameter to `wandb.init()`:

```python
import wandb

entity = "<entity>"
project = "<project>"

for group in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    for i in range(3):
        with wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project, group=group, name=f"{group}_run_{i}") as run:
            # Simulate some training
            for step in range(100):
                run.log({
                    "acc": 0.5 + (step / 100) * 0.3 + (i * 0.05),
                    "loss": 1.0 - (step / 100) * 0.5
                })
```


### Job type
Add a job type to a run by passing the `job_type` parameter to `wandb.init()`. For example, the following code snippet creates runs with job types of either `training` or `evaluation`:

```python
for job_type in ["training", "evaluation"]:
    for i in range(2):
        with wandb.init(entity=entity, project=project, job_type=job_type, name=f"{job_type}_run_{i}") as run:
            # Simulate some process
            for step in range(50):
                run.log({
                    "metric1": 0.2 + (step / 50) * 0.4 + (i * 0.03),
                    "metric2": 0.8 - (step / 50) * 0.3
                })

```

Within the W&B App, you can [view runs organized by group or job type](/models/runs/grouping#view-runs-by-group-or-job-type). The following image shows runs organized by the job type:

### View runs by group or job type

1. In the project sidebar, select either the **Runs** tab or the **Workspace** tab.
2. Above the list of runs, click the **Group** button (it looks like a lined sheet of paper).
3. From the dropdown, select either **Group** or **Job Type**.

{/* ## Create a group

You can interactively create run groups in the W&B App. To create a new run group:

1. Navigate to your W&B project.
1. Select the **Workspace** or **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
1. Click **New group**. Type a group name, then submit the form. */}

## Remove run group

1. In the project sidebar, select either the **Runs** tab or the **Workspace** tab.
2. Above the list of runs, click the **Group** button (it looks like a lined sheet of paper).
3. From the dropdown, click the **X** next to the name of the group you want to remove.

## Move runs between groups

1. Navigate to your W&B project.
1. Select the **Workspace** or **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
1. Select one or more runs by clicking their checkboxes.
1. Above the table, click **Move to group**.
1. Within the modal, select the target group or create a new group.
1. Click **Move**.

## Delete a group
To delete a group, remove all runs from it. This automatically deletes the group.
