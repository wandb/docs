Use regular expressions (RegEx) to find runs with the regular expression you specify. When you type a query in the search box, that will filter down the visible runs in the graphs on the workspace as well as filtering the rows of the table.


## Search End Time for runs

We provide a column named `End Time` that logs that last heartbeat from the client process. The field is hidden by default.
