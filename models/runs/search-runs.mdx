description: Learn how to search runs using regular expressions and export the runs table to CSV in the W&B App.

Use regular expressions (RegEx) to find runs with the regular expression you specify. When you type a query in the search box, that will filter down the visible runs in the graphs on the workspace as well as filtering the rows of the table.


## Search for runs by end time
The **End Time** column logs the last heartbeat from the client process. The column [is hidden by default](/models/track/project-page#customize-columns).
