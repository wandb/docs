Filter runs based on their status, [tags](#filter-runs-with-tags), [regular expressions (RegEx)](#filter-runs-with-regular-expressions-regex) or other properties with the filter button.

{/* See Customize run colors for more information on how to [edit, randomize, and reset run colors](/models/runs/run-colors/). */}

### Filter runs with tags

Filter runs based on their tags with the filter button.

1. Click on the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Select the **Filter** button, which looks like a funnel, at the top of the runs table.
3. From left to right, select `"Tags"` from the dropdown menu, select a logic operator, and select a filter search value.

### Filter runs with regex

If regex doesn't provide you the desired results, you can make use of [tags](/models/runs/filter-runs/#filter-runs-with-tags) to filter out the runs in Runs Table. Tags can be added either on run creation or after they're finished. Once the tags are added to a run, you can add a tag filter as shown in the gif below.


1. Click on the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Click on the search box at the top of the runs table.
3. Ensure that the **RegEx** toggle (.*) is enabled (the toggle should be blue).
4. Enter your regular expression in the search box.

### Filter runs by other properties
You can filter runs by other properties such as run name, ID, or metrics using the filter button.

## Search runs

Filter all rows by an expression with the **Filter** button above the dashboard.

Select **Add filter** to add one or more filters to your rows. Three dropdown menus will appear. From left to right the filter types are based on: Column name, Operator , and Values

|                   | Column name | Binary relation    | Value       |
| -----------       | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Accepted values   | String       |  &equals;, &ne;, &le;, &ge;, IN, NOT IN,  | Integer, float, string, timestamp, null |


The expression editor shows a list of options for each term. Column names and logical predicate structures are completed automatically as you type. You can connect multiple logical predicates into one expression using "and" or "or" (and sometimes parentheses).


{/*
## Edit run colors

When a new run is created, it is assigned a default color. You can edit the color for a given run by clicking the color preview.

{/*
Look for a green dot next to the name of runs— this indicates they're active in the table and on the graph legends.
*/}

{/*
## Bulk select runs

Delete multiple runs at once, or tag a group of runs— bulk selection makes it easier to keep the runs table organized.
