description: Learn how to filter runs in the Runs table using the expression editor.
title: Filter runs
---

Filter runs based on their name, state, [tags](#filter-runs-with-tags), or other properties with the expression editor in the Runs Table.

When you add a filter, you first choose a field (for example, tags, timestamp, or entity). Each field has an underlying type, such as text, time, or ID.

The list of operators you see (for example, is, in, &ge;, within last) depends on this type. After you choose a field, the UI only shows operators that are valid for that field’s type.

## Common operators by type

| Filter type | Example fields | Common operators | Example usage |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Tags        | `tags`           | is, is not, in, not in  | `tags is "baseline"` |
| Time        | `created timestamp`      | &le;, &ge;, within last | `created timestamp` &ge; `01/16/2026` |
| String      | `state`         | &equals;, &ne;, IN, NOT IN | `state = "finished"` |

<Note>
The above table shows only a subset of available fields and operators. The expression editor shows all available fields and operators.

## Create a filter expression

1. Navigate to the **Runs** tab from the project sidebar.
2. Select the **Filter** button, which looks like a funnel, above the runs table.
3. From left to right, select a column name, a logical operator, and a filter value to create a filter expression.
4. Optionally select **New Filter** to apply additional filters.

## Default filters

By default, W&B provides the following filters:

* **Show only my works**: Shows only runs created by the current user.
* **Hide crashed runs**: Hides runs with the `crashed` state.

Default filters appear as toggles below the **New filter** button in the filter expression editor.

## Remove a filter

To remove a filter from the Runs table:
1. Click on the **Filter** button, which looks like a funnel, above the runs table.
2. Select the `x` icon next to the filter you want to remove.

{/*
Look for a green dot next to the name of runs— this indicates they're active in the table and on the graph legends.

## Bulk select runs

Delete multiple runs at once, or tag a group of runs— bulk selection makes it easier to keep the runs table organized.
