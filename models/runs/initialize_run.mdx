title: Initialize a run
---

Initialize a W&B Run with [`wandb.init()`](/models/ref/python/functions/init). The following code snippet shows how to import the W&B Python SDK and initialize a run. 

Ensure to replace values enclosed in angle brackets (`< >`) with your own values:

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(entity="<entity>", project="<project>") as run:
    # Your code here
```

When you initialize a run, W&B logs your run to the project you specify for the project field (`wandb.init(project="<project>"`). W&B creates a new project if the project does not already exist. If the project already exists, W&B stores the run in that project.

<Note>
If you do not specify a project name, W&B stores the run in a project called `Uncategorized`.
</Note>

Each run in W&B has a [unique identifier known as a *run ID*](#unique-run-identifiers). [You can specify a unique ID](#unique-run-identifiers) or let [W&B randomly generate one for you](#autogenerated-run-ids).

Each run also has a human-readable, non-unique [run name](#name-your-run). You can specify a name for your run or let W&B randomly generate one for you. You can rename a run after initializing it.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```python title="basic.py"
import wandb

with wandb.init(entity="nico", project="awesome-project") as run:
    # Your code here
```
The code snippet produces the following output:

```bash
🚀 View run exalted-darkness-6 at: 
https://wandb.ai/nico/awesome-project/runs/pgbn9y21
Find logs at: wandb/run-20241106_090747-pgbn9y21/logs
```

The output shows that W&B logs the run `exalted-darkness-6` to the project `awesome-project` under the entity `nico`. `pgbn9y21` is the unique run ID that W&B generates for this run.

Each run has a state that describes the current status of the run. See [Run states](#run-states) for a full list of possible run states.
