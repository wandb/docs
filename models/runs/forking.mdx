title: Fork a run
---

<Warning>
The ability to fork a run is in private preview. Contact W&B Support at support@wandb.com to request access to this feature.
</Warning>

Explore different parameters or models from a specific point in an experiment without impacting the original run. To do this, *fork* from an existing W&B run. When you fork from a run, W&B creates a new run based on the the source run's `run ID` and `step`. After you initialize a forked run, you can continue logging to the new run independently from the source run.

<Note>
* Forking a run requires [`wandb`](https://pypi.org/project/wandb/) SDK version >= 0.16.5
* Forking a run requires monotonically increasing steps. Attempting to set a fork point with non-monotonic steps defined with [`define_metric()`](/models/ref/python/experiments/run#define_metric) is not supported, because it would disrupt the essential chronological order of run history and system metrics.
</Note>

Use the `fork_from` parameter in [`wandb.init()`](/models/ref/python/functions/init) to fork from an existing run. Specify the source run's unique `run ID` and the `step` you want to start the forked run from. 

<Note>
See [Unique run identifiers](/models/runs/run-identifiers#unique-run-identifiers) to learn more about run IDs and how to locate them.

## Fork from a previously logged run

The following code snippet shows how to fork from a run that was previously logged to W&B. Use this approach to fork from a run in a different script or notebook, or from a run logged by a different user or service account.

Replace `<source-run-id>`, `<project>`, and `<entity>` with your own values.

```python
import wandb

# The unique ID of the source run to fork from
source_run_id = "<source-run-id>"

# Specify the step to fork from
fork_step = 200

# Fork the run
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>",
    fork_from=f"{source_run_id}?_step={fork_step}",
) as forked_run:
    pass
```

## Fork from a run in the same script

The following code snippet shows how to fork from a run within the same script. This might occur if you want explore different parameters or models from a specific point within the same script or notebook.

```python
import wandb

# Initialize a run
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>"
) as original_run:
    # ...training logic goes here ...
    pass

# Specify the step to fork from
fork_step = 200

# Use the original run's ID and specify the step to fork from
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>",
    fork_from=f"{original_run.id}?_step={fork_step}",
) as forked_run:
    # ...training logic goes here ...
    pass
```

Use the `original_run.id` property to obtain the unique run ID of the original run.

### Example script

For example, the following code example shows how to first fork a run and then how to log metrics to the forked run starting from a training step of 200. 

Copy and paste the following code into a Python script or notebook cell. Replace `<project>` and `<entity>` with your own values.

```python
import wandb
import math

# Initialize the first run and log some metrics
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>"
) as run1:
    for i in range(300):
        run1.log({"metric": i})

# Fork from the first run at a specific step and log the
# metric starting from step 200
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>", 
    entity="<entity>", 
    fork_from=f"{run1.id}?_step=200"
) as run2:
    # Continue logging in the new run
    # For the first few steps, log the metric as is from run1
    # After step 250, start logging the spikey pattern
    for i in range(200, 300):
        if i < 250:
            # Continue logging from run1 without spikes
            metric_value = i
        else:
            # Introduce the spikey behavior starting from step 250
            metric_value = i + (2 * math.sin(i / 3.0))  # Apply a subtle spikey pattern

        # Log both metrics in a single call to ensure they're
        # logged at the same step
        run2.log({
            "metric": metric_value,
            "additional_metric": i * 1.1
        })
```

<Note>
**Rewind and forking compatibility**

Forking compliments a [`rewind`](/models/runs/rewind/) by providing more flexibility in managing and experimenting with your runs. 

When you fork from a run, W&B creates a new branch off a run at a specific point to try different parameters or models. 

When you  rewind a run, W&B let's you correct or modify the run history itself.
