title: Fork a run

<Warning>
The ability to fork a run is in private preview. Contact W&B Support at support@wandb.com to request access to this feature.
</Warning>

Explore different parameters or models from a specific point in an experiment without impacting the original run. To do this, "fork" from an existing W&B run. When you fork from a run, W&B creates a new run based on the the source run's `run ID` and `step`.

{/* Use `fork_from` when you initialize a run with [`wandb.init()`](/models/ref/python/functions/init) to "fork" from an existing W&B run. When you fork from a run, W&B creates a new run using the `run ID` and `step` of the source run. */}

<Note>
* Forking a run requires [`wandb`](https://pypi.org/project/wandb/) SDK version >= 0.16.5
* Forking a run requires monotonically increasing steps. You can not use non-monotonic steps defined with [`define_metric()`](/models/ref/python/experiments/run#define_metric) to set a fork point because it would disrupt the essential chronological order of run history and system metrics.
</Note>


## Start a forked run

Use the `fork_from` parameter in [`wandb.init()`](/models/ref/python/functions/init) to fork from an existing run. Specify the source run's unique `run ID` and the `step` you want to start the forked run from.

<Note>
See [Unique run identifiers](/models/runs/run-identifiers#unique-run-identifiers) to learn more about run IDs and how to locate them.
</Note>

The following code snippet shows how to fork a run that was logged to W&B. Replace `<source-run-id>`, `<project>`, and `<entity>` with your own values.

```python
import wandb

# The unique ID of the source run to fork from
source_run_id = "<source-run-id>"

# Specify the step to fork from
fork_step = 200

# Fork the run
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>",
    fork_from=f"{source_run_id}?_step={fork_step}",
) as forked_run:
    pass
```

The following code snippet shows how to fork from a run created in the same script. In this example, you:

1. Intialize the source run
1. Initialize the forked run using the `fork_from` parameter to specify the source run's ID and the step to fork from.

```python
import wandb

# Initialize a run
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>"
) as original_run:
    # ...training logic goes here ...
    pass

# Specify the step to fork from
fork_step = 200

# Use the original run's ID and specify the step to fork from
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>",
    fork_from=f"{original_run.id}?_step={fork_step}",
) as forked_run:
    # ...training logic goes here ...
    pass
```

Note that you use the `original_run.id` property to obtain the unique run ID of the source run.

## Continue from a forked run
After initializing a forked run, you can continue logging to the new run. You can log the same metrics for continuity and introduce new metrics. 

For example, the following code example shows how to first fork a run and then how to log metrics to the forked run starting from a training step of 200:

```python
import wandb
import math

# Initialize the first run and log some metrics
with wandb.init(
    project="<project>",
    entity="<entity>"
) as run1:
    for i in range(300):
        run1.log({"metric": i})

# Fork from the first run at a specific step and log the
# metric starting from step 200
with wandb.init(
    project="your_project_name", 
    entity="your_entity_name", 
    fork_from=f"{run1.id}?_step=200"
) as run2:
    # Continue logging in the new run
    # For the first few steps, log the metric as is from run1
    # After step 250, start logging the spikey pattern
    for i in range(200, 300):
        if i < 250:
            # Continue logging from run1 without spikes
            metric_value = i
        else:
            # Introduce the spikey behavior starting from step 250
            metric_value = i + (2 * math.sin(i / 3.0))  # Apply a subtle spikey pattern

        # Log both metrics in a single call to ensure they're
        # logged at the same step
        run2.log({
            "metric": metric_value,
            "additional_metric": i * 1.1
        })
```

<Note>
**Rewind and forking compatibility**

Forking compliments a [`rewind`](/models/runs/rewind/) by providing more flexibility in managing and experimenting with your runs. 

When you fork from a run, W&B creates a new branch off a run at a specific point to try different parameters or models. 

When you  rewind a run, W&B let's you correct or modify the run history itself.
