Use W&B Tables to visualize and query tabular data. For example:

* Compare how different models perform on the same test set
* Identify patterns in your data
* Look at sample model predictions visually
* Query to find commonly misclassified examples

The above image shows a table with semantic segmentation and custom metrics. View this table here in this [sample project from the W&B ML Course](https://wandb.ai/av-team/mlops-course-001).

## How it works

A Table is a two-dimensional grid of data where each column has a single type of data. Tables support primitive and numeric types, as well as nested lists, dictionaries, and rich media types. 

## Log a Table

Log a table with a few lines of code:

- [`wandb.init()`](/models/ref/python/functions/init): Create a [run](/models/runs/) to track results.
- [`wandb.Table()`](/models/ref/python/data-types/table): Create a new table object.
  - `columns`: Set the column names.
  - `data`: Set the contents of the table.
- [`run.log()`](/models/ref/python/experiments/run.md/#method-runlog): Log the table to save it to W&B.

```python
import wandb

with wandb.init(project="table-test") as run:
    my_table = wandb.Table(columns=["a", "b"], data=[["a1", "b1"], ["a2", "b2"]])
    run.log({"Table Name": my_table})
```
