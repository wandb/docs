W&B Core provides capabilities across the entire ML lifecycle. With W&B Core, you can:

- [Version and manage ML](/models/artifacts/) pipelines with full lineage tracing for easy auditing and reproducibility.
- Explore and evaluate data and metrics using [interactive, configurable visualizations](/models/tables/).
- [Document and share](/models/reports/) insights across the entire organization by generating live reports in digestible, visual formats that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.
- [Query and create visualizations of your data](/models/app/features/panels/query-panels/) that serve your custom needs.
- [Protect sensitive strings using secrets](/platform/secrets/).
- Configure automations that trigger key workflows for [model CI/CD](/models/automations/).
